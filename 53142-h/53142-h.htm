<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> day Beardsley left his stool and ledger
in a London insurance office and betook
himself seriously to the illustration of that
strange comic world of Congreve, a new manifestation
of English art blossomed. It had,
no doubt, been a long time germinating in the
minds of many men, and there had been
numerous signs pointing the way on which the
artistic tendencies of the nineties would travel.
For example, just about the same time as
Beardsley’s eighteenth year, a coterie of young
men, fresh from the Varsity in many cases,
made their appearance in London openly proclaiming
the doctrine of art for art’s sake under
the ægis of Oscar Wilde. So in the last age of
hansom cabs and dying Victorian etiquette,
these young men determined that the rather
dull art and literary world of London should
flower like another Paris.</p>

<p>If, for the sake of making a beginning, one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2">2</a></span>
must fix on that memorable day when Beardsley
burnt his boats as the date of the opening of
the period of the nineties, it must be remembered
that this arbitrary limitation of the
movement is rather a convenience than a necessity.
To divide up anything so continuous as
literature and art into sections like a bookcase
is uncommonly like damming up a portion of a
stream to look at the fish in it. It breaks the
contact between what was before and what
came after. However, as one must go a long
way back to investigate accurately how a new
movement in art arises, and as it is tedious to
follow up all the clues that lead to the source,
it will be perhaps as well not to worry too
much over the causes of the movement or over
the influences from which it arose. Let us
accept the fact so well pointed out by Mr.
W.&nbsp;G. Blaikie Murdoch in <cite>The Renaissance
of the Nineties</cite>, that the output of the nineties
was ‘a distinct secession from the art of the
previous age ..., in fact the eighties, if they
have a distinct character, were a time of transition,
a period of simmering for revolt rather
than of actual outbreak; and it was in the
succeeding ten years that, thanks to certain
young men, an upheaval was really made.’</p>

<p>It is to France if anywhere we can trace the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3">3</a></span>
causes of this new attitude. First of all, in
painting, the great French impressionists, with
Manet and Monet leading them; the doctrine
of plein air painting, and all the wonder of
this new school of painting gave a new thrill to
art. Then about 1885 the literary symbolists
killed the Parnassian school of poetry, while at
the same time there was a new <i xml:lang="it" lang="it">esplozione
naturlistica</i>. Paris, always the city of light,
was again fluting new melodies for the world.
In the Rue de Rome, Stéphane Mallarmé received
all the world of art and letters. To the
Rue de Rome came Whistler, John Payne,
George Moore, Oscar Wilde, and others. The
French influence that swept over to England
was as powerful as that which stirred artistic
Germany, creating a German period of the
nineties in the group of symbolists who, under
Stefan George, issued the now famous <cite xml:lang="de" lang="de">Blätter
für die Kunst</cite>. The Englishmen, indeed, who
attended these soirées of the Rue de Rome did
not come away empty-handed. Not only did
their own work suffer an artistic change
through this influence, but they handed it on
to their successors. So directly and indirectly
the great French painters and writers of the
day influenced the art of England, creating the
opportunity for a distinct secession from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4">4</a></span>
art of the previous age. At the same time
French art and literature were never stationary
but always developing. It was only in 1890
that we find the real Régnier appearing. In
the same year Paul Fort, just eighteen summers
like Beardsley, founded the Théâtre d’Art. All
this French art at high pressure had a stimulating
effect on English art; and, in fact, remained
its main stimulus until the Boer War,
when the imperialism of writers like Kipling
became the chief interest. So it was in no
small degree the literary symbolists, the plein
air painters and all the motives that lay behind
them, that awoke the Englishmen of the
nineties to new possibilities in art and life. In
Paris, in 1890, Rothenstein met Conder, and at
once the two became lifelong friends. There
they encountered artists like Toulouse Lautrec
and Anquetin.</p>

<p>The first men, of course, to realise this feverish
activity in France were the elder men, who
handed on the tidings to the younger majority.
Thus the men of the eighties turned
the attention of the unknown of the
nineties towards France, so that Englishmen
again began to remember that something else
counted in Paris besides lingerie. In dealing
then with the influences that helped to beget<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5">5</a></span>
the period, it is as well to remember that if
Walter Pater and Whistler were its forerunners,
so to speak, Oscar Wilde and George Moore
were responsible in no small degree for many
of the tendencies that afterwards became
prevalent.</p>

<p>Wilde himself, in fact, was artistically an
influence for evil on his weaker juniors. His
social success, his keen persiflage, his indolent
pose of greatness, blinded them as much as it
did the <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">οἱ πολλοί</span> to his real artistic industry
and merit. His worst works were, in fact,
with one exception, his disciples. Richard
Le Gallienne in his <cite>Quest of the Golden
Girl</cite> and <cite>Prose Fancies</cite> was watered-down
Wilde, and very thin at that. Even John
Davidson, in <cite>Baptist Lake</cite> and <cite>Earl Lavender</cite>,
strove in vain to overtake the masterly ease
with which Wilde’s ordered prose periods advance
like cohorts of centurions to the sound
of a full orchestra. Wilde’s best work&mdash;his
<cite>Prose Poems</cite>, his poem <cite>The Harlot’s House</cite>, his
one-acter <cite>Salomé</cite>, and one or two of the stories
in the <cite>House of Pomegranates</cite>&mdash;will, however,
remain as some of the finest flowers of the age’s
art. Yet Wilde, in reality, was senior to the
nineties proper, and was much too good an
artist to approve of much of the work that was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6">6</a></span>
done in imitation of himself during the period
by the mere hangers-on of the nineties. He
was with the men of the nineties, but not of
them. Beardsley, indeed, the age’s real king,
took the liberty of mocking at Wilde in the
very illustrations, or rather decorations, intended
for Wilde’s most elaborate production.
Wilde, in his turn, never wrote for <cite>The Yellow
Book</cite>, which he disliked intensely. Again, we
know what Symons’s opinion of Wilde was from
his essay on him as a poseur. In fact, Wilde
was a writer apart from the others, though
undoubtedly his presence among them up to
the time of his débâcle was a profound direct
influence.</p>

<p>On the other hand, George Moore, as a reactionary
influence against Victorianism,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> as a
senior who had lived and written in Paris, was
more of an indirect factor for the younger men.
For a time he lived in the Temple, where many
of them had come to live. By his works he
helped to disseminate the influences of the great
French writers and painters that had come into
his own life. His own writings came to others
surcharged with ‘The poisonous honey of
France.’ In his <cite>Modern Painting</cite>, in his novel,
<cite>Evelyn Innes</cite>, in his era of servitude to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7">7</a></span>
Flaubert’s majesty, he is of the nineties. But
the nineties with George Moore were merely a
phase out of which he grew, as out of many
others. But when the nineties began Moore
contrived to assist at their birth in the same
way as he did later at that of the Celtic renaissance.
Indeed, it is said, in Moore’s novel,
<cite>Mike Fletcher</cite> (1889), one can obtain a glimpse
of the manner in which the period was to
burgeon.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> See his <cite>Literature at Nurse</cite>, 1885.</p></div>

<p>There was, indeed, amongst the younger men
in those early days a wonderful spirit of camaraderie.
It was an attractive period full of the
glamour of youth before it went down fighting
for Art with a capital A, before age had chilled
its blood or dulled its vision. And there came,
no doubt, an immense vitality for them all, a
stimulating energy to each one, from this
meeting together in London. Indeed, coming
together by chance, as it were, in London, they
not only discovered one another and the ineffable
boon of comradeship, but they also rediscovered,
through Whistler, London for art. So
once again the streets of London began to be
written about, not it is true in the Dickens
manner, but still with even as great a love as
his. They went so far as to attempt to institute
real French café life, by having meetings<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8">8</a></span>
at the Cheshire Cheese and evenings in the
Domino Room of the Café Royal. Symons
wrote of the ballets of Leicester Square;
Dowson of the purlieus round the docks;
Davidson made poems of Fleet Street; Binyon
sang of white St. Martin’s and the golden
gallery of St. Paul’s; Crackanthorpe sketched
his London vignettes; Street talks of the indefinable
romance of Mayfair. In fact the
nineties brought the Muses back to town. In
a cabman’s shelter, in Soho restaurants of
doubtful cheapness, in each other’s rooms, they
rejoiced in each other’s company. At the same
time Beardsley, by a stroke of luck through
the good services of friends, was commissioned
by Mr. Dent to illustrate <cite>Le Morte d’Arthur</cite>.
The Bodley Press had begun in Vigo Street in
1887. Symons, Yeats, and others had already
published their first books. The curtain had
gone up on the drama of the nineties, of which
this is intended as a brief appreciation.</p>

<p>At the date of the appearance of these young
men amid a mass of lucubrators, there was
actually a band of genuine young writers
(besides the big Victorians like Meredith and
Hardy), who were turning out good work, and
who were under the sway of that old Pan of
poetry, Henley of <cite>The National Observer</cite>. These<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9">9</a></span>
young men of Henley must not be therefore
confused with the <cite>Yellow Book</cite> group. They
were often deliberately coarse, not because they
liked it, but because it was part of their artistic
gospel. And when one considers the methods
of the feeblest of them, one sees more ruffianly
sturdy British horseplay than art, more braying
and snarling than sounding on the lute. But
among the best of them, Stevenson, Kipling,
and Steevens, was a fine loyalty to the traditions
of the leading spirit of the <cite>Observer</cite> Henley&mdash;Pan
playing on his reed with his crippled hoofs
hiding amid the water-lilies of the purling
stream. All these last writers and artists were
men of the Anglo-Saxon tradition; while, on
the other hand, the young men who had, so to
speak, just come to town, were full of the Latin
tradition. The main thing in the lives of these
last was French literature and art, and out of
this influence came not only the art, but the
eccentricities, of the coterie, which is so often
called the nineties. Theirs was a new spirit.
They were of the order of the delectable ‘Les
Jeunes.’ Epigram opened a new career with
Oscar Wilde; Beardsley dreamed of a strange
world; Ernest Dowson used to drink hashish
and make love in Soho in the French manner
of Henri Murger’s Latin Quarter&mdash;for a time,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10">10</a></span>
indeed, hair was worn long, and the ties of the
petty homunculi of the Wilde crowd were of
lace; but, fortunately, artists like Beardsley
and the other men worth while did not cultivate
foolishness except as a protection against
the bourgeois.</p>

<p>But enough of these affectations; the point
I wish to bring out here is that the men who
drew and wrote for <cite>The Savoy</cite> wrote their art
with a difference to that of those others who were
their contemporaries but appeared in the first
instance as a virile imperialistic movement in
<cite>The Scots Observer</cite> and <cite>The National Observer</cite>.
The artists of the nineties were more, as we
say rather badly in English, of the ‘kid-glove
school.’ A note of refinement, a distinction
of utterance, an obsession in Art marked all
their best as well as their worst work. But
this by no means prevented the two schools
having a very salutary influence on each other.
Indeed, we find a man like Mr. W.&nbsp;B. Yeats,
who really belonged to a third movement, his
own Celtic renaissance, publishing first of all
lyrics like ‘The Lake Isle of Innisfree’ under
the banner of Henley, and attending a year or
two later the Rhymers’ Club meetings before
he found his own demesne. But to his former
comrades of the Cheshire Cheese, the men<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11">11</a></span>
who concern us here, Yeats has found occasion
to render befitting praise in the well-known
lines:</p>

<p>In fact, since influences and counter-influences
in all ages of literature are such subtle vermin
to ferret out, I propose to avoid as far as possible
any generalities in that connection, and to
interpret broadly and briefly a somewhat vague
period that reviewers have acquired the habit
of calling ‘the nineties.’ What then was this
period? It was a portion of the last decade of
the last century which began about 1890, and
passing through the Rhymers’ Club, blossomed
out into <cite>The Yellow Book</cite> and <cite>The Savoy</cite> periodicals,
and produced works like Beardsley’s
drawings, Conder’s fans, Dowson’s poetry, and
Hubert Crackanthorpe’s short stories. The
men who composed the group are too numerous
to recall in their entirety, even if a satisfactory
list of such a nature could be produced. So all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12">12</a></span>
I intend to attempt here is a summary of the
activities of certain typical examples of the
group as will serve to furnish an appreciation
of their general work. And the way I propose
to obtain this view is to begin by considering
Beardsley as the central figure of the period;
to deal next with the two most vital manifestoes
of the movement and their respective literary
editors, <cite>The Yellow Book</cite> and Henry Harland,
<cite>The Savoy</cite> and Mr. Arthur Symons, passing
on in turn to the writers of fiction, the poets,
the essayists and dramatists not of the whole
decade, but only to those with whom this particular
movement is concerned; it will then be
time to make a few deductions on the spirit of
the whole of this tendency. By rigidly adhering
to only those men who were actually of the
nineties group I am only too conscious these
pages will be considered often to be lacking in
the great literary events and figures of the age,
such as Hardy’s <cite>Jude the Obscure</cite>, the rise of
the Kipling star, the tragedy of Wilde, the
coming of Conrad, etc. etc. Yet the sole
object of this scant summary would be defeated
if I began to prattle of these and others like
Bernard Shaw. In fact its <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">raison d’être</i> constrains
a method of treatment which must not
be broken.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">To</span> begin with Aubrey Beardsley has many
advantages, for it brings us at once
not only to the type of mentality most representative
of the period, but also to the man
whose creative power was probably the greatest
factor of the period, to the boy who changed,
as has been said, the black and white art
of the world, and to the artist, from whose
work we can most easily deduce the leading
contemporary characteristics. The art of these
men was in a way abnormal, while the men
themselves who produced it were exotics; and
Beardsley’s is not only the most abnormal art
of them all, but also he himself is the greatest
exotic. As Robert Ross well said as a mere
comment on the decade, he is invaluable:
‘He sums up all the delightful manias, all
that is best in modern appreciation&mdash;Greek
vases, Italian primitives, the “Hypnerotomachia,”
Chinese porcelain, Japanese kakemonos,
Renaissance friezes, old French and
English furniture, rare enamels, mediæval<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14">14</a></span>
illumination, the débonnaire masters of the
eighteenth century, the English pre-Raphaelites.’
In Beardsley, so to speak, was inset all
the influences that went to make the period
what it was. And another reason why it
is so convenient to begin with him is that
he and not Oscar Wilde was in reality the
great creative genius of the age. Besides his
black-and-white work all the world knows, in
which, as Father Gray says, ‘His imaginative
gifts never showed a sign of fatigue or exhaustion,’<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a>
Beardsley practised in other arts.
While a youngster at Brighton he promised
to become a musical prodigy, and in later days
Symons describes him at a Wagner concert gripping
the seat with nervous intensity. He wrote
some charming poetry, and as picturesque a
fairy tale for grown-ups as has ever been
written in <cite>Under the Hill</cite>. In an interview
he states, probably slyly, he was at work in
1895 on a modern novel<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a>; while in 1897 he
said, ‘Cazotte has inspired me to make some
small contes. I have one in hand now called
<cite>The Celestial Lover</cite>.’ He began once to write
a play with the actor, Brandon Thomas. In<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15">15</a></span>
his late illustrations for Gautier’s <cite>Mademoiselle
de Maupin</cite> he was clearly working towards
water-colour work, while at one time he began
under Walter Sickert his only oil painting (unfinished),
‘Women regarding a dead mouse.’
By no means least, he became a leader in
English poster work. All of this was essentially
creative work. And when death came he
was very far from his artistic or intellectual
maturity. So is it not just to say that this
young man who practised nearly all the forms
of art, and who was also an avid reader and
student, remains the chief creative figure of the
nineties?</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> <cite>Last Letters of Aubrey Beardsley</cite>, with an Introduction
by the Rev. John Gray, 1904.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_3" href="#FNanchor_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> <cite>The Sketch</cite>, April 10, 1895.</p></div>

<p>Indeed, there is no more pleasing personality
in the whole period than this ‘apostle of the
grotesque,’ as his own decade loved to hail
him. Born at Brighton in 1872 he was educated
at the local Grammar School, whose
magazine, <cite>Past and Present</cite>, contains his
earliest work. The Kate Greenaway picture
books, it is said, started him drawing. At
school he was neither keen on his work or
games, but used to be continually doing
‘little rough, humorous sketches.’ Reading
was his great refuge, and when he fell in with
some volumes of the Restoration dramatists he
had already begun to find his feet in that world<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16">16</a></span>
of the mad lusts of Wycherley and the perfumed
artificiality of Congreve. Of school life
itself he speaks bitterly and with no regret.
At sixteen he must have been particularly glad
to escape from it and enter, first of all, an
architect’s office in London, and then, the next
year, the Guardian Life and Fire Assurance
Office, where his fatal illness unfortunately
first began to reveal its presence. Then came
his seed-time up till 1891, when he did
little but amateur theatricals. But at length
Beardsley discovered himself. Many gentlemen
have subsequently stated that they discovered
him. It may be that they discovered
him for themselves, but it was Beardsley and
Beardsley alone who found himself. He certainly
received, however, a large amount of
appreciative sympathy when he started to
draw a series of illustrations in his spare
time for Congreve’s <cite>Way of the World</cite>,
and Marlowe’s <cite>Tamburlaine</cite>. He was without
art training in the usual sense, though he went
of nights in 1892 to Professor Brown’s night
school at Westminster, but still kept to the
Insurance Office stool till August, when, after
being recognised by Burne-Jones and Watts
with kindness, he left his post to live by his
art. What had probably actually permitted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17">17</a></span>
him to take this step was the commission
given by J.&nbsp;M. Dent to illustrate <cite>Le Morte
d’Arthur</cite>. Any way he was launched out by
the first number of <cite>The Studio</cite> with Joseph
Pennell’s article on ‘A New Illustrator,’ and,
what was more important, with eleven of
Beardsley’s own works. At that time all his
art was intuitive without much knowledge
of modern black and white. Indeed he was
artistically swamped at the moment with the
glory of the pre-Raphaelites and Burne-Jones.
The <cite>Le Morte d’Arthur</cite>, really, was intended
as a kind of rival to the Kelmscott Press publications,
and Beardsley in his border designs
had small difficulty in excelling Morris’s work.</p>

<p>Next year, 1893, finds these influences modified
to a certain extent, although the <cite>Salomé</cite>
drawings still belong to that cadaverous, lean
and hungry world of Burne-Jones, from which
Beardsley has not completely as yet rescued
himself by means of Frenchmen like Constantin
Guys; but his release has well arrived
in 1894 with his design ‘The Fat Woman,’
a caricature of Mrs. Whistler. Watteau,
Rops, and the Japanese, and the thousand
books he is now reading throw open at last all
the splendour of the art world to him. He
lacks nothing, and he goes forward borrowing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18">18</a></span>
lavishly, like Shakespeare, from any source
that suits him. Beardsley’s illustrations are
generally critical decorations, although it must
never be forgotten he did attempt on more
than one occasion a series of illustration pure
and simple in, for example, his early scenes for
<cite>Manon Lescaut</cite>, <cite>La Dame aux Camélias</cite>, and
<cite>Madame Bovary</cite>, which are not altogether successful.
He is perhaps at his best as the
illustrating critic, which he is somewhat scornfully
in <cite>Salomé</cite>, very happily in Pope’s <cite>The
Rape of the Lock</cite>, and triumphantly in Aristophanes’
<cite>Lysistrata</cite>. It can be said of his work,
rather sweepingly no doubt, but still truthfully,
he began by decorating books with his
<cite>Le Morte d’Arthur</cite>; he then tried illustrating
them; but wound up in criticising them by his
decorations. ‘Have you noticed,’ he once
wrote to Father Gray, ‘have you noticed that
no book ever gets well illustrated once it becomes
a classic? Contemporary illustrations
are the only ones of any value or interest.’
But Beardsley was always more than a mere
illustrator, for where a learned Editor writes
notes and annotations on Aristophanes, he
decorates him; where Arthur Symons would
write an essay on <cite>Mademoiselle de Maupin</cite>,
Beardsley does a number of critical designs.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19">19</a></span>
It was, in fact, an age of the critical function;
but Beardsley’s criticism is of that supreme
kind Oscar Wilde called ‘creative criticism.’</p>

<p>At one time it was customary for critics to
plead that he was only a supreme imitator of
the Japanese or somebody; but, in reality, as
has been pointed out by Robert Ross in his
admirable essays on his work, he was as intensely
original as an illustrator as Sandro
Botticelli was in his designs for Dante’s Divine
Comedy, or William Blake for the drama of
Job. None of them interpreted authors for
dull people who could not understand what they
read. Perhaps the very best way to appreciate
his work of this kind is often to take it away
from the text, and say this is the way Beardsley
saw <cite>The Rape of the Lock</cite>. As for all the
supposed influences he is pretended to have
laboured under, it can be at once said, he was
too restless a personality to accept merely one
influence at a time. If he took from anywhere,
he took from everywhere, and the result is a
great and original draughtsman, the music of
whose line has been the theme of many artists.
With little stippled lines in the background,
and masses of black in the foreground, the
Wagnerites burgeon forth. Black and white
in some of his drawings even tell us the colour<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">20</a></span>
of some of the silks his women wear, and his
white is the plain white of the paper, not the
Chinese subterfuge. A few rhythmic pen-strokes
on the virgin sheet and strangely vital
people live. The hand of Salomé may be out
of drawing, the anatomy of Lysistrata wrong;
but, all the same, they live with a rich malevolent
life. One has to go back to the Greek
vase-painters to find such a vivid life realised
with such simple effects. This simplicity and
austerity of lines, these few dots for the telling
eyelashes, these blank spaces of untouched
paper almost insult one with the perfect ease
with which everything is accomplished. But,
as a matter of fact, how different, how difficult
was the actual creation of these designs!
What infinite pains, what knowledge went to
their composition! ‘He sketched everything
in pencil, at first covering the paper with
apparent scrawls, constantly rubbed out and
blocked in again, until the whole surface became
raddled from pencil, indiarubber, and
knife; over this incoherent surface he worked
in Chinese ink with a gold pen, often ignoring
the pencil lines, afterwards carefully removed.
So every drawing was invented, built up, and
completed on the same sheet of paper.’<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> ‘But<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21">21</a></span>
Beardsley’s subtlety does not lie only in his
technique, but also in what he expresses
thereby. Looking at his drawings, one always
feels in the presence of something alive, something
containing deep human interest; and
the reason is that, while Beardsley seldom
aimed at realistic rendering of the human
form, he was a superb realist in another
respect, this being that his workmanship
always proved itself adequate for the expression
of the most subtle emotions, and for
the embodiment of the artist’s unique personality.’<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a></p>

<p>This charming personality stood him in
good stead when the Beardsley craze burst upon
London. He had literally set the Thames on
fire. It was in 1894, when he became art
editor of <cite>The Yellow Book</cite> (which I discuss on
another page), that the craze began in earnest.
His poster for Dr. John Todhunter’s <cite>The
Comedy of Sighs</cite>, at the Avenue Theatre, a
three-quarter-length figure of a woman in
deep blue, standing behind a gauze curtain
powdered with light green spots, electrified the
dull hoardings of London. Another poster,
the female figure in a salmon-pink dress<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22">22</a></span>
standing opposite a second-hand bookshop,
with its scheme of black, green, orange, and
salmon pink, advertising Fisher Unwin’s <cite>Pseudonym
Library</cite>, flashed its colours gaily amid
a mass of stupid commercial advertising.
<cite>Punch</cite> parodied ‘The Blessed Damozel’ with
a new version of lauds for ‘The Beardsley
Girl.’ A famous tea-shop exploited the type
of female beauty.</p>

<p>Oscar Wilde’s play <cite>Salomé</cite> was illustrated by
the newly arrived young artist. The columns
of the papers and magazines spread his fame,
or more often belittled it. The new art
magazine, <cite>The Studio</cite>, not only raised him to
the skies, but had its first cover done by him.
And all this happened to a boy who had only
been gone from school six years, and whose
total age when he became the art craze of
London was only twenty-two. But he was not
to stop there. After four more years of
crowded, feverish work he was to die, after
having affected all the black and white art
of the world. He was to be at once accepted
in Paris. He was to raise a shoal of imitators,
and to influence more or less detrimentally
dozens of good artists.</p>

<p>Yet all this phenomenal success was not to
change his charming personality in the least.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23">23</a></span>
He still remained Aubrey Beardsley, the boy
doomed to death, but still with the lovable
heart of a boy who wanted to enjoy life.</p>

<p>Max Beerbohm has given us a wonderful personal
record of his friend, in which he says: ‘For
him, as for the schoolboy whose holidays are
near their close, every hour&mdash;every minute,
even&mdash;had its value. His drawings, his compositions
in prose and in verse, his reading&mdash;these
things were not enough to satisfy his
strenuous demands on life. He was an accomplished
musician, he was a great frequenter of
concerts, and seldom when he was in London
did he miss a “Wagner night” at Covent
Garden. He loved dining-out, and, in fact,
gaiety of any kind.... He was always most
content where there was the greatest noise and
bustle, the largest number of people, and the
most brilliant light.’ In the Domino Room
of the Café Royal in London; outside the
Brighton Pavilion, whose architecture haunted
him all his life, Beardsley was at home and
happy. ‘I am really happy,’ he writes, ‘in
Paris.’ And it was Beardsley’s chief preoccupation
to communicate in his drawings the
surprise and delight which this visible world
afforded him&mdash;a world of strange demi-mondaines
and eupeptic stockbrokers, of odd social<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24">24</a></span>
parasites and gullible idiots. He always had
an engaging smile that was delightful for
friends and strangers; while he was big
enough, Robert Ross chronicles, to make
friends and remain friends with many for
whom his art was totally unintelligible.</p>

<p>After he vacated <cite>The Yellow Book</cite> art
editorship, and <cite>The Savoy</cite> had been issued,
Leonard Smithers became the real Beardsley
publisher. There were no dead-locks with
him as to nude Amors, for Smithers had a
courage of his own&mdash;a courage great enough
to issue <cite>The Ballad of Reading Gaol</cite> when
Wilde was under his cloud, and no other publisher
would look at it. It was Smithers who
issued <cite>The Savoy</cite>, the two books of <cite>Fifty
Drawings</cite>, <cite>The Rape of the Lock</cite>, <cite>The Pierrot
of the Minute</cite>, the designs for <cite>Mademoiselle de
Maupin</cite>, and among others the eight ‘Lysistrata’
and the four ‘Juvenal’ drawings. For
any one to study all this variety and rapid
growth to an astounding maturity of conception
and execution no better volumes can be
recommended than <cite>A Book of Fifty Drawings</cite>
(1897), and <cite>A Second Book of Fifty Drawings</cite>
(1899). The former book is much the better of
the two, for the latter is a book of scraps to
a large extent. Indeed, in the first book all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25">25</a></span>
the drawings were fortunately selected by both
Beardsley himself and Smithers. The artist
allowed no drawing to appear in it with which
he was at all dissatisfied. It includes his
favourite, ‘The Ascension of St. Rose of
Lima’; but one cannot help thinking that
there have crept into it far too many of
his immature <cite>Le Morte d’Arthur</cite> series. For
when this volume was issued he had completely
discarded that painful method of
design. Indeed, the <cite>Salomé</cite> decorations (1894)
had bridged this brief spell of his puerility
to the rich fulfilment of <cite>The Rape of the Lock</cite>
(1896). Whistler at once saw this difference,
for, it is on record, when Beardsley first showed
these last designs to him he ‘looked at them
first indifferently, then with interest, then with
delight. And then he said slowly, “Aubrey, I
have made a very great mistake, you are a very
great artist.” And the boy burst out crying.
All Whistler could say, when he could say
anything, was, “I mean it&mdash;I mean it.”’</p>

<p>In reality one can of course now see signs of
the real artist even in the <cite>Le Morte d’Arthur</cite>
series. For example, the true Beardsley type
of woman appears in the design entitled ‘How
Queen Guenever made her a Nun.’ These
Beardsley women, Wilde hinted, were first<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">26</a></span>
invented by the artist and then copied by
nature. They have, indeed, been the cause
of much fine writing, one androgynist
describing them as the fruit of a French
bagnio and a Chinese visitor. As Pierre Caume
demanded of Félicien Rops we are moved to
ask of Beardsley:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza" xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">
<span class="i0">Quels éclairs ont nimbé tes fillettes pâlies?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quel stupre assez pervers, quel amour devasté<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Met des reflets d’absinthe en leurs melancolies?<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">They belong to the same world as the women
of Toulouse Lautrec, Rops, Odélon Redon,
Bayros, and Rassenfosse&mdash;the type known as
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">la loupeuse insatiable et cupide</i>. They move and
have their being in French erotica and novels
like <cite>La Faustine</cite>.</p>

<p>Beardsley had now (1896) reached his best
period with <cite>The Rape of the Lock</cite> and <cite>The
Lysistrata</cite> of Aristophanes, and of the two the
palm should be awarded to the eight designs of
the latter work. No one has yet dared to say
that these are probably his masterpieces; but
some day, when the kinship between Beardsley
and those old Greek Masters who designed
their exquisite vases and wine cups is established,
this truism may also come to light. It
is unlikely, however, to become revealed until<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27">27</a></span>
Aristophanes himself is fully translated in the
vulgar tongue, for not even the most generous
Editor in his monumental edition has essayed
that impertinence to Mrs. Grundy. The
illustrations or rather critical decorations of
Beardsley are also not likely to become generally
circulated to all because of their frankness.
For phallism is purely pornographic if
it has nothing to do with your subject. But
unfortunately it is a considerable factor in the
<cite>Lysistrata</cite>, as every scholar knows. Beardsley
himself in his letters lays considerable emphasis
on the fact that he was illustrating Aristophanes
and not Donnay’s French version of the same.
And never was he more cynical or more incisive;
never did he use fewer lines with more effect;
never was love and its depravities more scathingly
or so disdainfully ridiculed. In all there
were eight drawings issued with a variant of the
third, though I have reason to believe there
was also a ninth, and even this, his worst
erotic drawing, has nothing to do with
obscenity. He had learned too much from the
men who designed the old Hellenic pottery
to be obscene. He was frank as Chaucer is
frank, not vicious as Aretino delighted to be,
or indecent like the English artists Rowlandson<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28">28</a></span>
and James Gillray were in some of their
fantasies. Virgil dying wanted to destroy his
Æneids, and Beardsley <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">in articulo mortis</i> wrote
‘to destroy all copies of <cite>Lysistrata</cite> and bawdy
drawings.’ Yet he has nothing to fear from
the genuine issue of those drawings that
remain, or from the numberless pirated copies
that have since exuded mysteriously into
places like Charing Cross Road. Even Fuchs
in his <cite>Erotische Kunst</cite> has to say: ‘Beardsley
is specially to be noticed for the refinement of
his conceptions, his ultra-modern culture, his
taste, his sense of proportion, his maturity of
execution. No harsh or discordant notes, no
violent tones. On the contrary, a wheedling
finesse. In some respects he is the “maladive”
beauty of our time incarnate.’ Beardsley,
indeed, never descended to the horrors of an
Alfred Kubin or to the tone of certain of
Bayros’s designs. He was neither immoral nor
moral, but unmoral like Rassenfosse or any one
else who has not a fixed ethical theory to
teach. In his Juvenal drawings (1897), his
five Lucian sketches (1894), and the <cite>Lysistrata</cite>
(1896) he went straight to the great gifts of
classical literature, and in touching classical
things he took on the ancient outlook via,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29">29</a></span>
I believe, those wonderful Greek vase designers<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a>
which he, so assiduous a haunter of the British
Museum, must have not only seen, but revelled
in. But of these the best and freest are the
<cite>Lysistrata</cite> conceptions; and to enjoy these one
needs an initiation that is not every man’s to
receive.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_6" href="#FNanchor_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> Ross says in his <cite>Aubrey Beardsley</cite>, p. 45, one of the
events which contributed ‘to give Beardsley a fresh impetus
and stimulate his method of expression’ about
the <cite>Salomé</cite> time was ‘a series of visits to the collection
of Greek vases in the British Museum (prompted by an
essay of Mr. D.&nbsp;S. MacColl).’</p></div>

<p>We are, however, more interested here with
the literary side of his work, which divides
itself into poetry and prose. As a poet
Beardsley has been accused of over-cleverness.
Whatever that criticism means I do not know.
Probably it implies some similar reflection
to the statement that a dandy is over-dressed.
I cannot, however, discover any such affectation
in, for example, that charming poem,
<cite>The Three Musicians</cite>, which recounts how the
soprano ‘lightly frocked,’ the slim boy who
dies ‘for réclame and recall at Paris,’ and the
Polish pianist, pleased with their thoughts,
their breakfast, and the summer day, wend their
way ‘along the path that skirts the wood’:</p>

<p>In <cite>The Ballad of a Barber</cite>, again, there is
nothing but a trill of song in limpid verse.
How Carrousel, the barber of Meridian Street,
who could ‘curl wit into the dullest face,’
became <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fou</i> of the thirteen-year-old King’s
daughter, so that</p>

</div>

<p class="in0">is a typical ninety <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">jeu d’esprit</i>, only much
better done than the average one. With the
fewest words Beardsley can sketch a scene or
character, as he used the fewest of lines in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31">31</a></span>
his drawings. This is even better exemplified
in his prose. Time and again a single
sentence of <cite>Under the Hill</cite> gives us a complete
picture:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Sporion was a tall, depraved young man, with a
slight stoop, a troubled walk, an oval, impassible
face, with its olive skin drawn lightly over the
bone, strong, scarlet lips, long Japanese eyes, and
a great gilt toupet.</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">We seem to gaze with the Abbé Fanfreluche at
the prints on his bedroom wall:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Within the delicate curved frames lived the
corrupt and gracious creatures of Dorat and his
school, slender children in masque and domino,
smiling horribly, exquisite lechers leaning over
the shoulders of smooth, doll-like girls, and doing
nothing in particular, terrible little Pierrots
posing as lady lovers and pointing at something
outside the picture, and unearthly fops and huge,
bird-like women mingling in some rococo room.</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">One rubs one’s eyes. Are these not the drawings
Franz von Bayros of Vienna realised later?
But Beardsley’s output of both prose and verse
is actually so limited that one cannot compare
his double art work to that of an artist like
Rossetti. When all is said and done, his great
literary work is the unfinished ‘fairy’ tale of
<cite>Under the Hill</cite>. In its complete form it
belongs to the class of works like Casanova’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32">32</a></span>
<cite>Mémoires</cite>, the <cite>Reigen</cite> of Schnitzler, the novels
of Restif de la Bretonne, and some of the
<cite>Thousand and One Nights</cite>. It is an enchanting
book in the same way as <cite>Mademoiselle de
Maupin</cite> or <cite>Le Roi Pausole</cite> are enchanting
books. In its rococo style it surpasses the best
rhythms of Wilde, who only succeeds in cataloguing
long lists of beautiful things, while
Aubrey Beardsley suggests more than he says
in the true impressionist way of all the writers
of the nineties. Indeed, the purple patches of
Beardsley are as rich in fine phrases as any
paragraphs of the period&mdash;as <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">faisandée</i> as
any French writer has written. Elizabethan
euphuists, Restoration conceit-makers, later
Latins with all the rich byzantium <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">floræ</i> of
brains like Apuleius, can make as finely-sounding
phrases, but I doubt whether they can
pack away in them as rich a pictorial glamour
as many of the writers of the nineties, and
Beardsley amongst them, achieved. We have
Helen in ‘a flutter of frilled things’ at ‘taper-time’
before her mirror displaying her neck
and shoulders ‘so wonderfully drawn,’ and her
‘little malicious breasts ... full of the irritation
of loveliness that can never be entirely
comprehended, or ever enjoyed to the utmost.’
Whole scenes of the book are unrolled before<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33">33</a></span>
us like priceless tapestries. The ‘<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">ombre</i> gateway
of the mysterious hill’ stands before us:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The place where he stood waved drowsily with
strange flowers, heavy with perfume, dripping
with odours. Gloomy and nameless weeds not to
be found in Mentzelius. Huge moths, so richly
winged they must have banqueted upon tapestries
and royal stuffs, slept on the pillars that flanked
either side of the gateway, and the eyes of all the
moths remained open and were burning and
bursting with a mesh of veins. The pillars were
fashioned in some pale stone, and rose up like
hymns in the praise of pleasure, for from
cap to base each one was carved with loving
sculptures....</p></blockquote>

<p>To read <cite>The Toilet of Helen</cite>, with its faint
echoes perhaps of Max Beerbohm’s ‘Toilet of
Sabina’ in <cite>The Perversion of Rouge</cite>, is to be
lured on by the sound of the sentences:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Before a toilet-table that shone like the altar of
Nôtre Dame des Victoires, Helen was seated in a
little dressing-gown of black and heliotrope. The
Coiffeur Cosmé was caring for her scented
chevelure, and with tiny silver tongs, warm from
the caresses of the flame, made delicious intelligent
curls that fell as lightly as a breath about her
forehead and over her eyebrows, and clustered
like tendrils round her neck. Her three favourite
girls, Pappelarde, Blanchemains, and Loureyne,
waited immediately upon her with perfume and
powder in delicate flaçons and frail cassolettes, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34">34</a></span>
held in porcelain jars the ravishing paints prepared
by Châteline for those cheeks and lips
which had grown a little pale with anguish of
exile. Her three favourite boys, Claud, Clair, and
Sarrasins, stood amorously about with salver, fan,
and napkin. Millamant held a slight tray of
slippers, Minette some tender gloves, La Popelinière&mdash;mistress
of the robes&mdash;was ready with a
frock of yellow and yellow. La Zambinella bore
the jewels, Florizel some flowers, Amadour a box
of various pins, and Vadius a box of sweets. Her
doves, ever in attendance, walked about the room
that was panelled with the gallant paintings
of Jean Baptiste Dorat, and some dwarfs and
doubtful creatures sat here and there lolling out
their tongues, pinching each other, and behaving
oddly enough.</p></blockquote>

<p>There you have a Beardsley drawing transfused
into words. The same is true of his
description of the woods of Auffray. The
same is true of the wonderful supper served on
the terrace to Helen and her guests amid the
gardens. To find such another supper in
literature one has to turn to some French
author, or, better still, to the ‘Cena Trimalchionis’
of Petronius himself. From this it
will be seen that Beardsley’s literary work,<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35">35</a></span>
like his black-and-white, though the embodiment
of the spirit of his age, is also of
the noble order of the highest things in art.
It is for this reason, indeed, that I have
selected Beardsley as the centre-piece of this
brief sketch of a movement that is dead and
gone. He was the incarnation of the spirit
of the age; but, when the fall of Wilde
killed the age and the Boer War buried it,
neither of these things disturbed or changed
the magic spell of his art. His age may die,
but he remains. Even now he has outlived the
fad period, while many of the books that were
written at that date by others and decorated
by him are only valuable to-day because of his
frontispiece or wrapper. One has not forgotten
those wrappers, for as one will not forget
the work of William Blake, one will not forget
that of Aubrey Beardsley. His enthusiasts
treasure the smallest fragment.</p>

<p class="in0"><span class="smcap">Like</span> all artistic and literary movements this
one had, in the shape of various periodicals, its
manifestoes. In fact, it was a period particularly
rich in this kind of fruit. In <cite>The Hobby
Horse</cite> the voices of the new spirit were mingled
for the first time with those of the past. There
were, among other magazines, <cite>The Rose Leaf</cite>,
<cite>The Chameleon</cite>, <cite>The Spirit Lamp</cite>, <cite>The Pageant</cite>,
<cite>The Evergreen</cite>, <cite>The Parade</cite>, <cite>The Quarto</cite>, <cite>The
Dome</cite>, <cite>The Chord</cite>, while among the popular
papers <cite>The Idler</cite>, <cite>To-Day</cite>, and <cite>Pick-me-Up</cite>
produced the work of men like Edgar Wilson
and S.&nbsp;H. Sime; and, further, <cite>The Butterfly</cite>,
<cite>The Poster</cite>, and <cite>The Studio</cite> must be carefully
studied for the tendencies of the time. But
the two principal organs of the movement
were, beyond all doubt, <cite>The Yellow Book</cite> and
<cite>The Savoy</cite>. Round them, as around the
shrines of old beside the Ægean, gather the
faithful and the chosen. In the other publications
there was too much jostling with the
profane, but here ‘<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Procul profani</i>.’ It will be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37">37</a></span>
well, therefore, although it has been done more
or less before, to study these two magazines in
some detail, and also their literary editors who
gathered the clan together. In both cases
Beardsley was the art editor, though he was
‘fired,’ to put it plainly, from <cite>The Yellow Book</cite>
after its fourth number. His influence, therefore,
permeated both. In fact, he made them
both works of value for the coming generations,
and particularly in the case of <cite>The Savoy</cite> he
bore the burden of the day and saved the
monthly from fatuity. When he leaves <cite>The
Yellow Book</cite> it will be found to be never the
same. When he is too ill to be active in <cite>The
Savoy</cite> it becomes very small beer. So interwoven
with the lives and values of these
publications is the genius of Beardsley that one
cannot speak of the one without referring to
the other. Of Beardsley himself I have already
spoken, so I propose to confine myself strictly
to the art editor, while dealing first with <cite>The
Yellow Book</cite> and its literary editor, Henry
Harland, and then with <cite>The Savoy</cite> and Mr.
Arthur Symons.</p>

<p>The publisher, Mr. John Lane, says<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> this
much-discussed <cite>Yellow Book</cite> was founded one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38">38</a></span>
morning during half-an-hour’s chat over cigarettes,
at the Hogarth Club, by himself, Beardsley,
and Henry Harland. While he states that
‘Mr. Harland had the faculty of getting the
best from his contributors,’ the publisher goes
on to add: ‘Beardsley’s defect as art editor
was youth. He would not take himself
seriously; as an editor and draughtsman he
was almost a practical joker, for one had, so to
speak, to place his drawings under a microscope
and look at them upside down. This tendency,
on the eve of the production of Volume V.,
during my first visit to the United States,
rendered it necessary to omit his work from
that volume.’ Looking back on this, all that
one can say now is that although Beardsley
may have been trying, after all, he and not the
publisher was <cite>The Yellow Book</cite>, and with his
departure the spirit of the age slowly volatilised
from the work until it deteriorated into a kind
of dull keepsake of the Bodley Head. There
were thirteen numbers in all, and Beardsley
actually art-edited the first four. In the
charming prospectus for the fifth volume he is
still described as art editor, and four Beardsleys
were to have appeared in it: ‘Frontispiece to
the Chopin Nocturnes,’ ‘Atalanta,’ ‘Black
Coffee,’ and the portrait of Miss Letty Lind in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39">39</a></span>
‘An Artist’s Model.’ However, the break
came, and Beardsley had no further connection,
unfortunately, with the fifth volume.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_8" href="#FNanchor_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> In his pamphlet, <cite>Aubrey Beardsley and The Yellow
Book</cite>, p. 1. 1903.</p></div>

<p>The first number, as in the case of so many
similar periodicals, was brilliant. The standard
set was too high, indeed, to last, and to the
staid English literary press of the time it was
something of a seven days’ wonder. <cite>The Times</cite>
described its note as a ‘combination of English
rowdyism and French lubricity.’ <cite>The Westminster
Gazette</cite> asked for a ‘short Act of
Parliament to make this kind of thing illegal.’
Above all, the whole rabble descends howling
on the art editor. It is Beardsley that annoys
them, proving how he stands out at once
beyond his comrades. Against the literary
editor, Henry Harland, nothing is said; but
the press are full of the offences of one
Beardsley.</p>

<p>As Mr. J.&nbsp;M. Kennedy, in his <cite>English Literature,
1880–1905</cite>, has devoted an admirable, if
somewhat scornful, chapter to the contents of
<cite>The Yellow Book</cite>, it is to Henry Harland, who
seems to have merited all the charming things
said about him, that I would now direct
attention.</p>

<p>A delicate valetudinarian always in search of
health, he was born at Petrograd in March,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40">40</a></span>
1861. He commenced life in the surrogate of
New York State, whither his parents removed,
writing in his spare time in the eighties, under
the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">nom-de-plume</i> of Sidney Luska, sketches of
American Jewish life. Like Theodore Peters,
Whistler, and Henry James, he could not, however,
resist the call of the Old World, and he
was at journalistic work in London when he
was made editor of <cite>The Yellow Book</cite>. Besides
his editorial duties he was a regular contributor,
not only writing the series of notes signed
‘The Yellow Dwarf,’ but also turning out a
number of short stories. But London was only
to be a haven of brief sojourn for this writer,
whose health sent him south to Italy. Perhaps
his best work in the nineties was his short story
<cite>Mademoiselle Miss</cite>, while later in Italy he
opened up a new vein of dainty comedy fiction
in almost rose-leaf prose with <cite>The Cardinal’s
Snuff-Box</cite> (1900), whose happy delicacy of
thought and style he never equalled again, but
was always essaying to repeat until death
carried him off in Italy. Although, therefore,
sitting in the editorial chair at the Bodley
Head, Harland can only be said to have been a
bird of passage in the nineties, and not one of
its pillars like Arthur Symons of <cite>The Savoy</cite>.</p>

<p>This later publication was started as a rival<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41">41</a></span>
to <cite>The Yellow Book</cite> soon after Beardsley gave
up the art-editing of the earlier periodical.
In 1895, when ‘Symons and Dowson, Beardsley
and Conder, were all together on a holiday at
Dieppe ... it was there, in a cabaret Mr.
Sickert has repeatedly painted, that <cite>The Savoy</cite>
was originated.’<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> It was issued by Leonard
Smithers, the most extraordinary publisher, in
some respects, of the nineties, a kind of modern
Cellini, who produced some wonderfully finely
printed books, and was himself just as much a
part of the movement as any of its numerous
writers. Indeed, no survey of the period can
be complete without a brief consideration of
this man.</p>

p. 21. 1911.</p></div>

<p>But to return to <cite>The Savoy</cite>, it can be aptly
described as the fine flower of the publications
of the age. It is true <cite>The Yellow Book</cite> outlived
it, but never did the gospel of the times
flourish so exceedingly as in its pages. Here
we see that violent love for a strangeness of
proportion in art that was the keynote of the
age. Here the abnormal, the bizarre, found
their true home, and poetry is the pursuit of
the unattainable by the exotic. It will, therefore,
not perhaps be out of place before dealing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42">42</a></span>
with its literary editor, Mr. Arthur Symons, to
discuss the eight numbers that appeared.
Number one (printed by H.&nbsp;S. Nichols) appeared
as a quarterly in boards in January,
1896. An editorial note by Arthur Symons,
which originally appeared as a prospectus,
hoped that <cite>The Savoy</cite> would prove ‘a periodical
of an exclusively literary and artistic
kind.... All we ask from our contributors is
good work, and good work is all we offer our
readers.... We have not invented a new
point of view. We are not Realists, or
Romanticists, or Decadents. For us, all art is
good which is good art.’ The contents of the
number included a typical Shaw article, full,
like all of his work, of the obvious in the terms
of the scandalous; some short stories by Wedmore,
Dowson, Rudolf Dircks, Humphrey
James, and Yeats. The other articles were
hardly very original; but the contributions of
Beardsley dwarf everything else. He towers
out above all else with his illustrations, his
poem <cite>The Three Musicians</cite>, and the beginning
of his romantic story <cite>Under the Hill</cite>.</p>

<p>Number two (April, 1896, printed by the
Chiswick Press) had another editorial note
courageously thanking the critics of the Press
for their reception of the first number, which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43">43</a></span>
‘has been none the less flattering because it has
been for the most part unfavourable.’ The
contents included poems and stories by Symons,
Dowson, and Yeats, while John Gray and
Selwyn Image have poems and Wedmore a
story. Beardsley continues his romance, and
lifts the number out of the rut with his Wagneresque
designs. Max Beerbohm caricatures
him, and Shannon and Rothenstein are represented.
Among articles there is a series on
Verlaine; and Vincent O’Sullivan, in a paper
‘On the Kind of Fiction called Morbid,’ sounds
a note of the group with his conclusion: ‘Let
us cling by all means to our George Meredith,
our Henry James ... but then let us try, if
we cannot be towards others, unlike these, if
not encouraging, at the least not actively
hostile and harassing, when they go out in the
black night to follow their own sullen will-o’-the-wisps.’
He is also to be thanked for
registering the too little known name of the
American, Francis Saltus.</p>

<p>Number three (July, 1896) appeared in paper
covers, and <cite>The Savoy</cite> becomes a monthly
instead of a quarterly from now on. There is
a promise, unfulfilled, of the serial publication
of George Moore’s new novel, <cite>Evelyn Innes</cite>.
Yeats commences three articles on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44">44</a></span> <cite>William
Blake and his Illustrations to the ‘Divine
Comedy</cite>,’ and Hubert Crackanthorpe contributes
one of his best short stories. Owing to illness
Beardsley’s novel stops publication, but his
<cite>Ballad of a Barber</cite> relieves the monotony of
some dull stuff by the smaller men. The reproductions
of Blake’s illustrations are made to
fill the art gap of Beardsley, who has only two
black-and-whites in. The publication of his
novel in book form is promised when the artist
is well enough.</p>

<p>Number four (August, 1896) at once reveals
the effect of Beardsley’s inactivity through
illness, and shows that Beardsley is <cite>The Savoy</cite>,
and all else but leather and prunella. The
number, however, is saved by a story of Dowson,
<cite>The Dying of Francis Donne</cite>, and on the art
side a frontispiece for Balzac’s <cite xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">La Fille aux
Yeux d’Or</cite>, by Charles Conder, is interesting.</p>

<p>Number five (September, 1896) is for some
unaccountable reason the hardest number to
procure. Besides the cover and title-page it
contains only one Beardsley, <cite>The Woman in
White</cite>, but the cover is an exceptionally beautiful
Beardsley, the two figures in the park
holding a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">colloque sentimental</i> seem to have
stepped out of the pages of Verlaine’s poem.
Theodore Wratislaw and Ernest Rhys contribute<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45">45</a></span>
the stories. Dowson, Yeats, and the
Canadian, Bliss Carman, contribute the best of
the poetry.</p>

<p>Number six (October, 1896), has a very poor
art side, with the exception of Beardsley’s
familiar <cite>The Death of Pierrot</cite>. The literary
contents consists chiefly of the editor. One
notices the periodical is dying. The only
unique feature is a story, <cite>The Idiots</cite>, by
Conrad, and Dowson is still faithful with a
poem.</p>

<p>Number seven (November, 1896) announces
in a leaflet (dated October) the death of <cite>The
Savoy</cite> in the next number. The editorial note
states that the periodical ‘has, in the main,
conquered the prejudices of the press ... it
has not conquered the general public, and,
without the florins of the general public, no
magazine ... can expect to pay its way.’ In
this number Beardsley returns to attempt to
salve it with his remarkable translation of
Catullus: Carmen CI., and illustration thereto.
Yeats and Dowson contribute poems and
Beardsley his Tristan and Isolde drawing.</p>

<p>Number eight (December, 1896) completes
the issue. The whole of the literary contents
is by the Editor and the art contents by
Beardsley himself: in all fourteen drawings.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46">46</a></span>
By way of epilogue, Symons says in their next
venture, which is to appear twice a year, ‘that
they are going to make no attempt to be
popular.’ Unfortunately for English periodicals
it was a venture never essayed.</p>

<p>That <cite>The Savoy</cite> is far truer to the period
than <cite>The Yellow Book</cite> was perhaps in no small
way due to the fact that Mr. Arthur Symons
was its literary editor. For he at any rate in
his strenuous search for an æsthetical solution
for art and life, in his assiduous exploring in
the Latin literatures for richer colours and
stranger sensations&mdash;he, at any rate, has not
only been the child of his time, but in some
ways the father of it. His sincere love of art
is beyond all question, and it has sent him into
many strange byways. He has praised in purple
prose the bird-like motions and flower-like
colours of the ballet; he has taken us with him
to Spanish music-halls and Sevillian Churches;
he has garnered up carefully in English the
myths of the symbolists and translated for us
the enigmas of Mallarmé&mdash;<cite>Herodias</cite>, the blood
and roses of D’Annunzio’s plays and the throbbing
violins of Verlaine’s muse; he has taken
us to continental cities, and with him we have
heard Pachmann playing and seen the enchantments
of the divine Duse. All the cults of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47">47</a></span>
Seven Arts has this Admirable Crichton of
Æstheticism discussed. He has worked towards
a theory of æsthetics. He has written charmingly
(if somewhat temperamentally) of his
comrades like Beardsley, Crackanthorpe and
Dowson. He was a leader in the campaign of
the early nineties, and his work will always be
the guiding hand for those who come after him
and who wish to speak of this movement. As
early as 1893 he was writing of it as ‘The
Decadent Movement in Literature’ in <cite>Harper’s</cite>,
when he speaks of the most representative work
of the period: ‘After a fashion it is no doubt
a decadence; it has all the qualities that mark
the end of great periods, the qualities that we
find in the Greek, the Latin, decadence; an
intense self-consciousness, a restless curiosity in
research, an over-subtilising refinement upon
refinement, a spiritual and moral perversity.’
Perhaps, in a way, it is an immense pity that
Symons will become the universal guide to the
period, for it must be conceded that he has
always been prone to find perversity in anything,
as Sir Thomas Browne was haunted
with quincunxes. But of the subtilty of his
judgments and of the charming prose in which
he labours to express them there can be no
question. Listen, for example, when he speaks<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48">48</a></span>
of the aim of decadence: ‘To fix the last fine
shade, the quintessence of things; to fix it
fleetingly; to be a disembodied voice, and yet
the voice of a human soul; that is the ideal of
decadence.’ How beautifully it is said, so that
one almost forgets how dangerous it is. Very
aptly did Blaikie Murdoch say the Mantle of
Pater fell on him. It is the same murmured
litany of beautiful prose. Indeed Arthur
Symons is the supreme type of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">belles lettrist</i>.
Just as in the early nineties he prided himself
on the smell of patchouli about his verse, so he
alone remains to-day with the old familiar
scent about his writings of a period dead and
gone which exacts rightfully our highest respect.
As one owes him a debt of homage for his fine
faithfulness to art, so one thinks of him, as he
himself has written of Pater, as a ‘personality
withdrawn from action, which it despises or
dreads, solitary with its ideals, in the circle of
its “exquisite moments” in the Palace of Art,
where it is never quite at rest.’ How true that
last phrase is, ‘never quite at rest,’ of the
author. For to him Art is an escape&mdash;the
supreme escape from life.</p>

<p>Arthur Symons began with a study on
Browning and the volume <cite>Days and Nights</cite>
when the eighties were still feeling their way<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49">49</a></span>
towards the nineties. It was in <cite>Silhouettes</cite>
(1892) and <cite>London Nights</cite> (1895) that he
appeared as perhaps the most <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">outré</i> member of
the new movement. His perfection of technique
in endeavouring to catch the fleeting impression
by limiting it, never cataloguing it,
marks the difference of his verse and that of
the secession from much of the school of the
eighties’ definite listing of facts. Symons,
indeed, is not only a poet impressionist, but
also a critic impressionist in his critical works
like <cite>Studies in Two Literatures</cite>, <cite>The Symbolist
Movement in Literature</cite>, and so on. This
impressionism, whilst it makes his verse so
intangible and delicate, also endows his
appreciations with a certain all-pervading
subtlety. It is as though a poet had begun to
see with the Monet vision his own poems. It
is as though a man comes away with an impression
and is content with that impression on
which to base his judgment. It is New Year’s
Eve: the poet records his impression of the night:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">We heard the bells of midnight burying the year.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Then the night poured its silent waters over us.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And then in the vague darkness faint and tremulous,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Time paused; then the night filled with sound; morning was here.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>
<p class="in0"><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50">50</a></span>
The poet is at the Alhambra or Empire
Ballet: like an impressionist picture a poem
disengages the last fine shade of the scene. He
wanders at twilight in autumn through the
mist-enfolded lanes:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Night creeps across the darkening vale;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">On the horizon tree by tree<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fades into shadowy skies as pale,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As moonlight on a shadowy sea.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">The vision remains like an etching. The
poet is on the seashore at sunset:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The sea lies quietest beneath<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The after-sunset flush,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That leaves upon the heaped gray clouds<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The grape’s faint purple blush.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>It lingers like a water-colour in one’s memory.
He sees a girl at a restaurant and his poem is
at once an impression as vivid as a painter’s
work. In a phrase he can cage a mood, in a
quatrain a scene. Where does this ability
come from? The answer is, perhaps, given by
the one name Verlaine, whose genius Mr.
Symons has done so much to hail.</p>

<p>In the gay days of the early nineties before
black tragedy had clouded the heavens there
was no more daring secessionist from the tedious
old ways than the editor of <cite>The Savoy</cite>. To
those days, like Dowson’s lover of Cynara, he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51">51</a></span>
has ‘been faithful in his fashion.’ If the
interest is now not so vivid in his work it is
because the centre of art has shifted. If Mr.
Symons has not shifted his centre too, but
remained faithful to the old dead Gods, it is
no crime. It only means that we, when we
wish to see him as one of the figures of his
group, must shut up his volumes of criticism,
forget his views on Toulouse Lautrec and
Gerard Nerval, and William Blake, put aside
his later verses and his widow’s cruse of
writer’s recollections, and turn with assurance
to the débonnaire poet of <cite>Silhouettes</cite> and <cite>London
Nights</cite>.</p>

<p>It has been said that Mr. Symons stands for
‘a Pagan revolt against Puritanism.’ It is
argued, because he was nurtured in nonconformity,
art came to him with something of
the hysteria a revelation comes to a revivalist
meeting. This may be true, but I cannot help
thinking that no writer amid all these French
influences which he had so eagerly sought out
yet remains so typical of the English spirit.
It may be heresy, but I always see in mind the
gaiety of a Nice carnival in a certain drawing
with one solid, solemn face surveying the scene
over a starched front. Beneath it is written:
‘Find the Englishman.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52">52</a></span>
Like the American critic, James Huneker,
Mr. Arthur Symons has also occasionally
written short imaginative prose studies. One
thinks, too, in this respect of Walter Pater’s
wonderful <cite>Imaginary Portraits</cite> and particularly
his glorious study of Watteau, and I rather
think that this success must have moved the
spirit of the two later critics to a noble rivalry.
The best, indeed, of Mr. Symons’s <cite>Spiritual
Adventures</cite> are probably those studies which
are mostly attached to some theme of art which
has been after all the all-engrossing motive of
this delightful critic’s life. <cite>An Autumn City</cite>
and <cite>The Death of Peter Waydelin</cite>: the first, a
sensitive’s great love for Arles, whither he
brings his unresponsive bride; the other, a
study quaintly suggestive of a certain painter’s
life: both of these sketches are unquestionably
more moving than Mr. Symons’s studies of nonconformists
quivering at the thought of hell-fire.
To them one might add, perhaps, <cite>Esther
Kahn</cite>, the history of the psychological development
of an actress after the style of <cite>La
Faustine</cite>.</p>

<p>Mr. Symons’s favourite word is ‘escape’; his
favourite phrase ‘escape from life.’ Now the
one and now the other reappear continually in
all kinds of connections. Of John Addington<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53">53</a></span>
Symonds, for example, he writes: ‘All his work
was in part an escape, an escape from himself.’
Of Ernest Dowson’s indulgence in the squalid
debaucheries of the Brussels kermesse he
writes: ‘It was his own way of escape from
life.’ Passages of like tenor abound in his
writings; and, in one of his papers on <cite>The
Symbolist Movement in Literature</cite>, he explains
his meaning more precisely:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Our only chance, in this world, of a complete
happiness, lies in the measure of our success in
shutting the eyes of the mind, and deadening its
sense of hearing, and dulling the keenness of its
apprehension of the unknown.... As the present
passes from us, hardly to be enjoyed except as
memory or as hope, and only with an at best
partial recognition of the uncertainty or inutility
of both, it is with a kind of terror that we wake
up, every now and then, to the whole knowledge
of our ignorance, and to some perception of where
it is leading us. To live through a single day with
that overpowering consciousness of our real
position, which, in the moments in which alone it
mercifully comes, is like blinding light or the
thrust of a flaming sword, would drive any man
out of his senses.... And so there is a great silent
conspiracy between us to forget death; all our
lives are spent in busily forgetting death. That
is why we are so active about so many things
which we know to be unimportant, why we are
so afraid of solitude, and so thankful for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54">54</a></span>
company of our fellow creatures. Allowing ourselves
for the most part to be vaguely conscious of
that great suspense in which we live, we find our
escape from its sterile, annihilating reality, in
many dreams, in religion, passion, art; each a
forgetfulness, each a symbol of creation.... Each
is a kind of sublime selfishness, the saint, the
lover, and the artist having each an incommunicable
ecstasy which he esteems as his ultimate
attainment; however, in his lower moments, he
may serve God in action, or do the will of his
mistress, or minister to men by showing them a
little beauty. But it is before all things an
escape.</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. Symons finds in his system of æsthetics
an escape from Methodism and the Calvinistic
threatenings of his childhood. He wishes to
escape ‘hell.’ In the story of <cite>Seaward Lackland</cite>
there is a preacher whom Methodism drove
to madness. Mr. Symons has turned to Art so
that he may not feel the eternal flames taking
hold of him.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a id="III"></a>III</h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="smcap">One</span> endeavours to remember some one or two
outstanding novels written by any one of the
writers of this group. It must be at once admitted,
one fails to recall a great novel. It is
true that the great Victorians, Meredith and
Hardy, were hard at work at this time; but,
then, neither of these writers belongs to this
movement. Then there was Kipling, Stevenson,
Barrie, and George Moore. With the exception
of the last, we have little to do with these
here. They do not come within the scope of
the present study.</p>

<p>None of the men of the nineties (as I have
defined them) produced a great novel. It
would be well, however, to give at once some
connotation for so loose a term as ‘a great
novel.’ Let us then say that a good English
novel is not necessarily a great novel; nor, for
that matter, is a good Russian novel necessarily
a great novel. A great novel is a work of
fiction that has entered into the realm of universal
literature in the same way as the dramas<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56">56</a></span>
of Sophocles and Shakespeare and Molière have
entered that glorious demesne. As a matter
of fact, one can remember, I think in most
cases, very few English novels that are great in
this sense; while there are many more French
and Russian works that have an undeniable
right to this title. Therefore it is not, perhaps,
so damaging a criticism of the period as it
might at first sight appear to say it has produced
no great novel.</p>

<p>But in so far as English fiction alone is concerned,
it cannot be said that the men of the
nineties produced work of a very high order in
this form. They do not seem to have had the
staying power demanded in such artistic production.
The short poem, the short story, the
small black and white drawing, the one act
play&mdash;in fact, any form of art that just displays
the climacteric moment and discards the
rest pleased them. It was, as John Davidson
said, an age of Bovril. While the novel, it
must be admitted, needs either a profusion of
ideas, as in the case of the Russians, or of
genitals, as in the case of the French. But the
art of the nineties was essentially an expression
of moods&mdash;and moods, after all, are such evanescent
brief conditions. So it is not unnatural
that the fruition of the novel was not rich<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57">57</a></span>
among these writers. George Gissing and
George Moore, in a way their forebears (I have
in mind more particularly the latter), spread a
taste for such works. Indeed, in his <cite>Confessions
of a Young Man</cite>, George Moore may be said
to have predicted the masculine type of the
nineties. Gissing in 1891 was to daunt some
with his <cite>New Grub Street</cite>, while Henry James
was to inspire enthusiasm in a few like Hubert
Crackanthorpe. But naturally in the way of
stimulus the main goad was France, which was
at that date phenomenally rich in practitioners
of the art of the novel. The Vizetelly Zolas,
Mr. George Moore personally conducting the
novels of certain of the French novelists over
the Channel, the desire to smash the fetters of
Victorian fiction which Thomas Hardy was to
accomplish, were all inspiring sources which
were, however, singularly unfruitful. Walter
Pater long before in his academic romance
<cite>Marius</cite>, which they had all read eagerly, wrote
charmingly of a field that would appeal to
them when he said: ‘Life in modern London ... is
stuff sufficient for the fresh imagination of
a youth to build his “palace of art” of.’ But
instead of taking the recommendation of this
high priest they read <cite>Dorian Gray</cite>, which Wilde
would never have written if Huysmans had not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58">58</a></span>
first written <cite>A Rebours</cite>. The young men of
Henley, it must be confessed, did far finer work
than Richard Le Gallienne’s watery Wildism
in <cite>The Quest of the Golden Girl</cite>. George
Moore wrote a masterpiece in <cite>Evelyn Innes</cite>,
but Ernest Dowson and Arthur Moore in <cite>A
Comedy of Masks</cite> and <cite>Adrian Rome</cite> did not
retaliate. Leonard Merrick, who started publishing
in the eighties, did not publish his best
work till the nineties were dead and gone;
while his best Bohemian Paris stories may owe
as much to Du Maurier’s <cite>Trilby</cite> (1894) as they
do to Henri Murger. Henry Harland, as I
have already said, only struck his vein of
comedy fiction when the Boer War had finished
the movement. George Gissing and Arthur
Morrison belong, with Frank Harris, to the
pugilistic school of Henley’s young men,
while Richard Whiteing, who turned from
journalism to write <cite>No. 5 John Street</cite> (1899),
was too old a man and too late with his book
to belong to the nineties’ group. Arthur
Machen, in those days, belonged to the short
story writers with Hubert Crackanthorpe, who
was the great imaginative prose writer of
the group. The sailor, Joseph Conrad, the
Australian Louis Becke, the Canadian, C.&nbsp;G.&nbsp;D.
Roberts, were working out their own salvation,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59">59</a></span>
and had nothing to do with the Rhymers’ Club.
The strong creative brain of Aubrey Beardsley,
indeed, in his unfinished picaresque romance,
<cite>Under the Hill</cite>, which I have already mentioned,
produced something new, but it was not a novel;
while it is John Davidson’s poetry that counts,
not his novels, which remain unread nowadays
on the shelf.</p>

<p>Indeed, if the name of a good English novel
by any one of them is demanded, it will be
singularly difficult to suggest a satisfactory title.
One can even go further, and state that they
did not even have one amongst them who has
handed on to us a vivid picture of their own
lives in the form of fiction. Dowson, indeed,
in the dock life of his books may have autobiographical
touches, but they are purely personal.
What I mean is, that there was no one
standing by to give us a picture of them as
Willy, the French writer, has given us of the
sceptical yet juvenile enthusiasm of Les Jeunes
of Paris of the same period in, for example, his
<cite xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Maîtresse d’Esthètes</cite>. What is cruder than
Ranger-Gull’s <cite>The Hypocrite</cite>, which has pretensions
to be a picture of the young men of the
period? And when one comes to think of it this
is a great pity, as an excellent novel might have
been penned around the feverish activities of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60">60</a></span>
these young exotics of the nineties. Robert
Hichens’ <cite>Green Carnation</cite> is, after all, perhaps
the most brilliant attempt to picture the weaknesses
of the period, and it is merely a skit
taking off in the characters of Esmé Amarinth
and Lord Reggie two well-known personalities.
<cite>The Adventures of John Johns</cite>, it is true, is
supposed to be the history of the rise of one of
the smaller epigoni of the movement, but it is
not a very brilliant achievement, though it has
considerable merit and interest. One cannot
indeed say that it is up to the standard of
Ernest La Jeunesse’s <cite>Odin Howes</cite>, wherein the
French Jew has given a veritable flashing insight
on the last days of Wilde in Paris and
those holes into which he crept to drink.
What a pity, indeed, an English contemporary
has not done the same for the Tite Street days,
or given us in his book a serious study of the
strange world of Whistler or Dowson.</p>

<p>In the face of this strange dearth of novels
in this school one cannot help asking the
reasons that engendered it. Without laying
down any hard and fast rules, it will, I think,
be seen that this vacuity came from the
Zeitgeist of the group itself. As has been said,
the large canvas, the five-act play, the long
novel were <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">démodé</i> for the period. The age<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61">61</a></span>
demanded, after the long realistic studies of
the eighties in France, the climacteric moments
only when the passions of the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">personæ</i> of the
drama were at white heat, so to speak, and
life was lived intensely. Could not the great
scene up to which the five long acts lead be
squeezed into one? Was not the rediscovery
of the <cite>Mimes</cite> of Herod as a sign of the times?
Could not the great beauty of an immense
landscape’s spirit be caught and seized on a
small canvas? Could not the long-winded
novel of three tomes be whittled down to the
actual short-story motive? This reduction of
everything to its climax can be seen in all the
art of the period. Look at Beardsley’s decoration
for Wilde’s <cite>Salomé</cite>, entitled itself ‘The
Climax.’ Conder paints small objects like
fans and diminutive water-colours and Crackanthorpe
writes short stories. The poems of
Dowson are short swallow flights of song, and
the epic is reduced to Stephen Phillips’s
<cite>Marpessa</cite>. The one-act play begins on the
Continent to make a big appeal for more
recognition than that of a curtain-raiser.
Small theatres, particularly in Germany and
Austria, give evening performances consisting
of one-acters alone. It becomes the same in
music. The age was short-winded and its art,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62">62</a></span>
to borrow a phrase from the palæstra, could
only stay over short distances. So, whereas
there is a strange dearth of novels, the men
of the nineties were very fruitful in short
stories. In fact, it would not be perhaps too
much to say that it was then, for the first
time in English literature, the short story
came into its own. At any rate, it would be
more judicious to put the period as one in
which the short story flourished vigorously (if
not for the first time), in England, as a ‘theme
of art.’ To understand exactly what I mean
by this artistic treatment of the short story<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> as
a medium of literary expression, all that is
necessary is, perhaps, to compare one of
Dickens’s short tales, for example, with one of
Stevenson’s short stories. The result is apparent
at once in the difference of treatment&mdash;a difference
as essential as the difference between the
effect of a figure in stone and another in
bronze. The earlier tale has none of the facets
and subtleties that art has contrived to express
by the latter narration. This artistic treatment
of the short story by Englishmen, then,
was a new thing and a good thing for English<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63">63</a></span>
literature. If the long staying powers required
for the great novel in the world of comparative
literature did not belong to the writers of
the nineties group, at any rate they developed,
more or less artistically, the climacteric effects
of the <i>conte</i>. For the short story crossed the
Channel by means of Guy de Maupassant, and
out of it arose on this side for a brief decade
or so a wonderful wealth of art. The short
stories of Kipling are by no means the only
pebbles on the beach. In fact, never even in
France itself was there such variety of theme and
treatment. The successful short stories of the
period are of all sorts and conditions. To
exemplify as briefly as possible this variety is
perhaps closer to my purpose than to waste
time in proving such obvious facts as the
anxious endeavours of all these writers to
raise their work to the artistic elevation demanded
of the short story, or their strenuous
struggle to attain a suitable style and treatment
for their themes.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_10" href="#FNanchor_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> Frederick Wedmore in <cite>On Books and Arts</cite> (1899)
discusses the short story as a distinct artistic medium.
It can never be a ‘novel in a nutshell.’</p></div>

<p>Numerous examples of their art at once
crowd the mind, such as Ernest Dowson’s
<cite>Dying of Francis Donne</cite>, Max Beerbohm’s
<cite>Happy Hypocrite</cite>, Frederick Wedmore’s tender
<cite>Orgeas and Miradou</cite>, Arthur Symons’s <cite>Death
of Peter Waydelin</cite>, the works of Hubert<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64">64</a></span>
Crackanthorpe, or the fantastic tales of Arthur
Machen, or Eric Count Stenbock’s<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> <cite>Studies of
Death</cite>. H.&nbsp;D. Lowry, though of Henley’s
young men, works at the same art of studies in
sentiment in his <cite>Women’s Tragedies</cite>. So does
Mr. G.&nbsp;S. Street in his <cite>Episodes</cite> and George
Egerton in her <cite>Discords and Keynotes</cite>. Among
the others who deliberately tried to write the
short story as an artistic theme at that period
and who were at the same time in the movement
can be mentioned Henry Harland, Rudolf
Dircks in his <cite>Verisimilitudes</cite>, Richard Le<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65">65</a></span>
Gallienne, Kenneth Grahame, Percy Hemingway
in his <cite>Out of Egypt</cite>, etc. Then we
have men like R.&nbsp;B. Cunninghame Graham
and H.&nbsp;W. Nevinson, clearly influenced by the
movement and writing alongside of it of the
ends of the earth they have visited. The
former, for example, in a short story like
<cite xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Aurora La Cujiñi</cite> (Smithers, 1898) clearly
reflects the influences of this period which
gloried in the abnormal in Art. Known as a
socialist of courage, Mr. Graham, whose name
betrays his origin, has also visited many of the
exotic places of the world. In his able book
<cite>Mogreb-el-Acksa</cite> he has given us vignettes of
Morocco that are unsurpassed; in his volume
<cite>Success</cite> he has told us of those Spanish-speaking
races of South America, of the tango, and
the horses of the pampas, and the estancias he
knows so well. In <cite xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Aurora La Cujiñi</cite> we have
a vignette of Seville so realistic that we almost
believe that one is justified in considering that
there is just enough motive in it to vivify it
with the quickening touch of the short storyteller’s
wand. It is slow in starting, but
when this motive comes suddenly at the end
we are almost left breathless, realising that
everything that went before was but a slow,
ruthless piling up of local colour. It is all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66">66</a></span>
done with such deliberate deftness. How we
see the scenes unrolling slowly before us. Like
the thrilled people on the benches we watch
the Toreador about to make his kill as we
read:</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_11" href="#FNanchor_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> Eric Stenbock was at Balliol, Oxford. He collaborated
in a volume of translations of Balzac’s ‘Short Stories.’
He contributed to Lord Alfred Douglas’s <cite>The Spirit Lamp</cite>.
As a specimen of his style the following extract from his
short story, <cite>The Other Side</cite>, may be offered. It is supposed
to be an old Breton woman’s description of the
Black Mass:
</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘Then when they get to the top of the hill, there is an
altar with six candles quite black and a sort of something
in between, that nobody sees quite clearly, and the old
black ram with the man’s face and long horns begins to
say Mass in a sort of gibberish nobody understands,
and two black strange things like monkeys glide about
with the book and the cruets&mdash;and there’s music too,
such music. There are things the top half like black
cats, and the bottom part like men only their legs are
all covered with close black hair, and they play on the
bag-pipes, and when they come to the elevation then&mdash;.
Amid the old crones there was lying on the hearth-rug,
before the fire, a boy whose large lovely eyes dilated
and whose limbs quivered in the very ecstacy of terror.’</p></blockquote>
</div>

<p>The “espada” had come forward, mumbled
his boniment in Andaluz, swung his montera
over his shoulder upon the ground, and after
sticking his sword in every quarter of the bull
had butchered him at last amid the applause
of the assembled populace. Blood on the
sand; sun on the white plaza; upon the women’s
faces “cascarilla”; scarlet and yellow fans, and
white mantillas with “fleco y alamares” in the
antique style...; women selling water, calling
out “aguá!” in so guttural a voice it seemed
like Arabic; Cardobese hats, short jackets, and
from the plaza a scent of blood and sweat acting
like a rank aphrodisiac upon the crowd,
and making the women squeeze each other’s
sweating hands, and look ambiguously at one
another, as they were men; and causing the
youths, with swaying hips and with their hair
cut low upon their foreheads, to smile with
open lips and eyes that met your glance, as
they had been half women. Blood, harlotry,
sun, gay colours, flowers and waving palm-trees,
women with roses stuck behind their ears,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67">67</a></span>
mules covered up in harness of red worsted,
cigar girls, gipsies, tourists, soldiers, and the
little villainous-looking urchins, who, though
born old, do duty as children in the South.’</p>

<p>As we read this magical evocation of the
spirit of place we rub our eyes and ask ourselves
have we not been there. This prose of
vivid impressionism is the goal of one and all.
As the plein air school painted in the open air
before Nature, so these men must write as
closely round their subject as actual experience
can allow them. The vivid realisation of a
mood, as we shall see in Hubert Crackanthorpe,
is the desired prize. Turn through the pages
of Ernest Dowson’s <cite>Dilemmas</cite>, and read, above
all, <cite>A Case of Conscience</cite>; leaf Frederick Wedmore’s<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a>
<cite>Renunciations</cite>, and pause over <cite>The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68">68</a></span>
Chemist in the Suburbs</cite>, wherein, as H.&nbsp;D. Traill
said, the story of Richard Pelse’s life is a pure
joy; in both cases vivid impressionism and
mood realisation are the keynotes of the work.
To understand these tendencies better and the
excellence of the work achieved, it will be more
advantageous, perhaps, to consider in more
detail one writer only who carried the charm
of the prose pen to a higher degree of emphasis
and finish in the short story than any of
the others, to wit, Hubert Crackanthorpe.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_12" href="#FNanchor_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> About the worst of Frederick Wedmore’s short stories,
such as <cite>The North Coast and Eleanor</cite>, there is a hint of
the melodrama of Hugh Conway’s <cite>Called Back</cite>, but it is
a feeble replica of the original. The most successful of
his short imaginative pieces, as the author rightly terms
them, on the other hand, have a refined grace of slow
movement that is at once captivating and refreshing. It
seems impossible that the same man could have essayed
both the worst and the best. As a specimen of the
latter type of work, let me fasten on to the description
of the entourage of Pelse the chemist, the man with the
tastes above his position:
</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘There came a little snow. But in the parlour over
the shop&mdash;with the three windows closely curtained&mdash;one
could have forgetfulness of weather. There was the neat
fireplace; the little low tea-table; a bookcase in which
Pelse&mdash;before that critical event at Aix-les-Bains&mdash;had
been putting, gradually, first editions of the English
poets; a cabinet of china, in which&mdash;but always before
Aix-les-Bains&mdash;he had taken to accumulate some pretty
English things of whitest paste or finest painting; a
Worcester cup, with its exotic birds, its lasting gold, its
scale-blue ground, like lapis lazuli or sapphire; a Chelsea
figure; something from Swansea; white plates of Nantgarw,
bestrewn with Billingsley’s greyish pink roses, of
which he knew the beauty, the free artistic touch. How
the things had lost interest for him! “From the moment,”
says some French critic, “that a woman occupies
me, my collection does not exist.” And many a woman
may lay claim to occupy a French art critic; only one
had occupied Richard Pelse.’</p></blockquote>
</div>

<p>A curious anomaly can be remarked here,
that in this period the great work of prose
fiction was not to be resharpened by the young
men to nearly the same extent as they resharpened
the poetry and the essay. None<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69">69</a></span>
approach Meredith and Hardy, who move like
Titans of the age, while Kipling and Crackanthorpe
are the only two young men that give
any quantity of imaginative prose work of a
high new order (and in saying this one must not
overlook Arthur Morrison’s <cite>Mean Streets</cite>, or
Zangwill’s Ghetto Tales, or the work of Henry
James) until Conrad came from the sea and
Louis Becke from Australia to give new vistas
to our fiction. But it is not with them we are
concerned here, but with Hubert Crackanthorpe,<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a>
of whose life the poet has sung:</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_13" href="#FNanchor_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> It is interesting to note the verses also of the French
poet Francis Jammes dedicated to Crackanthorpe.
Jammes lived at Orthez when Crackanthorpe visited
that remote countryside.</p></div>

<p class="in0">Crackanthorpe commenced his literary career
as the editor, with W.&nbsp;H. Wilkins, of <cite>The
Albemarle</cite>, a monthly review started in January,
1892, with a splendid supplement lithograph.</p>

<p><cite>Wreckage</cite>, the younger writer’s first volume,
appeared in 1893, and contains seven studies of
very unequal merit. Its French inspiration as
well as its French emulation is at once apparent,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70">70</a></span>
for in place of a foreword is the simple, all-sufficing
French quotation as a keynote of the
type of work displayed: ‘Que le roman ait
cette religion que le siècle passé appelait de ce
large et vaste nom: “Humanité”;&mdash;il lui suffit
de cette conscience; son droit est là.’ The
youth of the writer (he was only twenty-eight)
must be remembered when discussing the inequality
of these studies in passion, for all
hinge on the old eternal theme. The last three
are perhaps more finished work than the first
four, and this is a pity from the point of view
of the reader. <cite>Profiles</cite>, indeed, the longest, is
also in some respects the worst-conceived
attempt. It is crude and immature in conception
and projection. A young officer, in
love with Lily Maguire, is deceived by her for
a very Emily Brontë-like figure of a bold, bad,
handsome man. The girl becomes a disreputable
member of the prostitute class, and Maurice,
like the young fool he is, wishes to redeem her.
But Lily, whom the sensuous, romantic life has
taught nothing, could never, she thinks, marry
a man she did not care for, although she would
sell herself to the first Tom, Dick, or Harry.
<cite>A Conflict of Egoisms</cite> concerns two people who
have wasted their lives and then utterly destroy
themselves by marrying one another, for they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71">71</a></span>
were too selfish to <em>live</em> even by themselves.
<cite>The Struggle for Life</cite> is a Maupassant<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a>-conceived,
but ineffectively told story of a wife
betrayed by her husband, who sells herself for
half-a-crown if she can go home in an hour.
<cite>Embers</cite> is much more effectively told, and here
at last we begin to realise Crackanthorpe is
getting at the back of his characters. The
same applies to that able gambling story, <cite>When
Greek meets Greek</cite>, while in <cite>A Dead Woman</cite> we
have Crackanthorpe at last in his full stride.
Rushout the innkeeper, inconsolable for his
dead wife, is as real as ‘bony and gaunt’
Jonathan Hays, who was the dead woman’s
lover. How the husband discovers the dead
woman’s infidelity; how he and Hays were to
have fought; and how at last ‘each remembered
that she had belonged to the other, and,
at that moment, they felt instinctively drawn
together,’ is told by a master’s hand with a slow
deliberation that is as relentless as life itself.
Here the narrative is direct and the delineation
of character sharp. These two men with the
card-sharper Simon live, while as for the women
of the book we wish to forget them, for they
have nothing to redeem them except possibly
the little French girl from Nice.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_14" href="#FNanchor_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> Maupassant’s <cite>Inconsolables</cite>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72">72</a></span></p></div>

<p>Two years later appeared a far more ambitious
and maturer volume containing half-a-dozen
sentimental studies and half-a-dozen
tales of the French villages Crackanthorpe so
loved and understood. His method of work
becomes more pronounced here, that is to treat
an English theme in the French manner, a task
which demands more culture than the ruck of
the conteurs for the English magazines attain
with their facile tears and jackass laughters,
their machine-like nonentities and pudibond
ineptitudes. Crackanthorpe, indeed, has left
no following behind him, and only once later
can I recall a volume of short stories that
suggests his manner: J.&nbsp;Y.&nbsp;F. Cooke’s tales
of the nineties in his <cite>Stories of Strange
Women</cite>.</p>

<p>In this new volume as before, Crackanthorpe
devotes himself to the expansion of the sentimental
study, the problems of sexual relationships,
which are not altogether pleasing to
every one, and this may account for his limited
appeal. In <cite>Wreckage</cite> all the women were vile,
but here he evidently intends to picture the
other side of women in Ella, the wife of the
poet Hillier, with its slow Flaubert unrolling
of her infinite delusion. In <cite>Battledore and
Shuttlecock</cite>, in Nita, of the old Empire<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73">73</a></span>
promenade days, he again develops the good
side. While in the study of the <cite>Love-sick
Curate</cite> we feel that Ethel is not hard-hearted,
but only that the Rev. Burkett is an unutterable
idiot. <cite>Modern Melodrama</cite> is the short,
sharp climacteric stab of Maupassant perhaps
not over well done. The sentimental studies
close with <cite>Yew-Trees and Peacocks</cite>, which
seems rather to have lost its point in the
telling. The tales of the Pyrennese villages
where Crackanthorpe used to stay are typical
productions of the delight of the men of the
nineties in their sojourning on the sacred soil
of France. <cite>The White Maize</cite>, <cite>Etienne Matton</cite>,
and <cite>Gaston Lalanne’s Child</cite> are perhaps not unworthy
of the master himself in their simple
directness, devoid of all unnecessary padding.
With a few phrases, indeed, Crackanthorpe
can lay his scene, strip his characters nude
before us. How we realise, for instance, Ella
lying in bed the night before her mistaken
marriage with Hillier. She is there in all
the virgin simplicity of the average English
country girl:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The window was wide open, and the muslin
curtains swaying in the breeze bulged towards
her weirdly. She could see the orchard trees
bathed in blackness, and above a square of sky,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74">74</a></span>
blue-grey, quivering with stifled light, flecked
with a disorder of stars that seemed ready to rain
upon the earth. After a while, little by little,
she distinguished the forms of the trees. Slowly,
monstrous, and sleek, the yellow moon was
rising.</p>

<p>She was no longer thinking of herself! She
had forgotten that to-morrow was her wedding-day:
for a moment, quite impersonally, she
watched the moonlight stealing through the
trees.</p></blockquote>

<p>Again, Ronald, the youth from the Army
Crammer’s, finds his way into the music-hall,
where he encounters Nita:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Immediately he entered the theatre, the sudden
sight of the scene stopped him, revealed, as it
were, through a great gap. The stage blazed
white; masses of recumbent girls, bathed in soft
tints, swayed to dreamy cadence of muffled
violins before the quivering gold-flecked minarets
of an Eastern palace. He leaned against the
side of the lounge to gaze down across the black
belt of heads. The sight bewildered him. By-and-bye,
he became conscious of a hum of voices,
and a continual movement behind him. Men, for
the most part in evening dress, were passing in procession
to and fro, some women amongst them, smiling
as they twittered mirthlessly; now and then
he caught glimpses of others seated before little
round tables, vacant, impassive, like waxwork
figures, he thought.... He was throbbing with
trepidating curiosity, buffeted by irresolution.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75">75</a></span>
With the same exactitude the lonely fells
around Scarsdale, where Burkett is parson of
the small Cumberland village, arise before us.</p>

<p>His posthumous volume, <cite>Last Studies</cite>, contains
only three rather long short stories, an
‘in memoriam’ poem by Stopford A. Brooke,
and an appreciation very gracefully done by
Henry James. Referring in the field of
fiction to the crudity of the old hands and
the antiquity of new, his appreciator finds it
difficult to render the aspect which constitutes
Crackanthorpe’s ‘troubled individual note.’
He comes to the conclusion, ‘What appealed
to him was the situation that asked for a
certain fineness of art, and that could best be
presented in a kind of foreshortened picture.’</p>

<p>The short story is mainly of two sorts:
‘The chain of items, figures in a kind of sum&mdash;one
of the simple rules&mdash;of movement,
added up as on a school-boy’s slate, and
with the correct total and its little flourish,
constituting the finish and accounting for the
effect; or else it may be an effort preferably
pictorial, a portrait of conditions, an attempt
to summarise, and compress for purposes of
presentation to “render” even, if possible, for
purposes of expression.’ From the French
Crackanthorpe learnt the latter method, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76">76</a></span>
practised it. When we come to look at these
last three stories (which with the tiny collection
of <cite>Vignettes</cite> completes his work) we see
how admirably exact is this criticism of his
senior.</p>

<p>In <cite>Antony Garstin’s Courtship</cite> he is back in
his own countryside of Cumberland among
the shrewd, hard Dale folk. It is a little
masterpiece conceived almost in the hopeless
bitterness of Hardy at his darkest, most
pessimistic moment. The crudeness in workmanship
has gone, only the relentless inevitability
of it all remains like the tragedies
of life itself. Rosa Blencarn, the parson’s
niece, a mere cheap flirt of unfinished comeliness,
is but the bone of contention between the
personalities of Antony and his mother. The
widow Garstin is as fine a character as Crackanthorpe,
in his twenty-two stories, has created.
She lives, and in her veins flows the passion of
disappointed age. ‘She was a heavy-built
woman, upright, stalwart almost, despite her
years. Her face was gaunt and sallow; deep
wrinkles accentuated the hardness of her
features. She wore a widow’s black cap above
her iron-grey hair, gold-rimmed spectacles, and
a soiled chequered apron.’ How easily we can
see her saying to her great hulking son:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77">77</a></span>
‘T’ hoose be mine, t’ Lord be praised,’ she
continued in a loud, hard voice, ‘an’ as long as
he spare me, Tony, I’ll na’ see Rosa Blencarn
set foot inside it.’</p>

<p>It has all the unsavoury cruelty of humanity,
and to find other such scenes in English literature
we have to come down to Caradoc Evans’s
<cite>My People</cite>, or James Joyce.</p>

<p>In <cite>Trevor Perkins</cite>, in a brief masterly way,
we have the soul of the average young man of
the nineties, who has ceased to believe in God
or tolerate his parents, sketched for us. He
walks out with the waitress of his bunshop, and
we realise at once he is of those who are
doomed to make fools of themselves on the
reef of her sex. The last story, <cite>The Turn of
the Wheel</cite>, is the history of the daughter
who believes in her self-made father, and
despises her sidetracked mother as an inferior
being, only to find she has made a great
mistake. It is one of the longest stories he
wrote, and moves easily in the higher strata of
London society. From this fashionable world
to the rude and rugged scars and fells of
Cumberland is a far cry; but here, as elsewhere,
Crackanthorpe finds the friction of
humanity is its own worst enemy. Yet behind
all this impenetrably impersonal bitter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78">78</a></span>
play of human passions in these short stories,
one feels somehow or other the distant beats
of the author’s compassionate heart, which his
sickness of life made him forcibly stop in the
pride of his youth before he had time to realise
himself or fulfil his rich promise.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a id="IV"></a>IV</h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="smcap">The</span> poetry of the period is essentially an
expression of moods and sentiments. It is as
much a form of impressionism as the art of
Monet and Renoir. Further, it seeks after,
like all the art of the nineties, that abnormality
of proportion of which Bacon wrote in
his ‘Essay on Beauty.’ It is, too, a period
wonderfully fertile in song. Besides the
nineties’ group, which is represented chiefly by
the Rhymers’ Club, there were many other
schools of song. Lord Alfred Douglas in his
<cite>City of the Soul</cite>, Oscar Wilde in his <cite>Sphinx</cite>
and <cite>The Harlot’s House</cite>, Stephen Phillips and
Henley, Francis Thompson in his <cite>Hound of
Heaven</cite>, are but some of the richness I am compelled
to pass over in order to adhere strictly to
the programme of this rough summary. Let
us, therefore, turn at once to the Rhymers’
Club, whose origin and desires have been so
well explained by Arthur Symons, the cicerone
to the age, in his essay on Ernest Dowson. At
the Cheshire Cheese in Fleet Street it was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80">80</a></span>
arranged that a band of young poets should
meet, striving to recapture in London something
of the Gallic spirit of art and the charm
of open discussion in the Latin Quartier. The
Club consisted of the following members:
John Davidson, Ernest Dowson, Edwin J.
Ellis, George Arthur Greene, Lionel Johnson,
Arthur Cecil Hillier, Richard Le Gallienne,
Victor Plarr, Ernest Radford, Ernest Rhys,
Thomas William Rolleston, Arthur Symons,
John Todhunter, and William Butler Yeats.
Besides these members, the Club, which was
without rules or officers, had at one time
affiliated to itself the following permanent
guests: John Gray, Edward Rose, J.&nbsp;T. Nettleship,
Morley Roberts, A.&nbsp;B. Chamberlain, Edward
Garnett, and William Theodore Peters.</p>

<p>Oscar Wilde, though never a member, had a
great influence on many of those who were,
and Victor Plarr describes a memorable meeting
of the Rhymers in Mr. Herbert Horne’s
rooms in the Fitzroy settlement at which Wilde
appeared. The poet goes on: ‘It was an evening
of notabilities. Mr. Walter Crane stood
with his back to the mantelpiece, deciding, very
kindly, on the merits of our effusions. And
round Oscar Wilde, not then under a cloud,
hovered reverently Lionel Johnson and Ernest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81">81</a></span>
Dowson, with others. This must have been in
1891, and I marvelled at the time to notice the
fascination which poor Wilde exercised over
the otherwise rational. He sat as it were
enthroned and surrounded by a differential
circle.’</p>

<p>The influence of Verlaine and the symbolist
poets of Paris in this circle was profound.
Every one had a passion for things French.
Symons translated the prose poems of Baudelaire
and the verses of Mallarmé, Dowson
is inspired by the ‘Fêtes Gallantes,’ and so on.
As Mr. Plarr writes: ‘Stray Gauls used to be
imported to grace literary circles here. I
remember one such&mdash;a rare instance of a rough
Frenchman&mdash;to whom Dowson was devoted.
When a Gaul appeared in a coterie we were
either silent, like the schoolgirls in their French
conversation hour, or we talked a weird un-French
French like the ladies in some of Du
Maurier’s drawings.’<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_15" href="#FNanchor_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> Victor Plarr, <cite>Ernest Dowson</cite>, p. 23. 1914.</p></div>

<p>Of course it must not be supposed, however,
that the nineties ever remained at all stationary
in this condition or entirely under these
influences. Mr. Plarr is speaking of the early
nineties, the age when John Gray’s <cite>Silverpoints</cite>
was perhaps a fair sample of the poetry of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82">82</a></span>
moment for this group; but, when at the same
time it must be remembered, poets like Francis
Thompson and William Watson were carrying
on the staider traditions of English poetry
altogether unmoved by these exotic influences
from Montmartre and the studios of the south.
The nineties group itself only remained for
a restive moment like this before each man was
to go his own way. They were indeed all souls
seeking the way to perfection in art. Yeats
went off to assist to found the Irish School;
Richard Le Gallienne went to America; Gray
became a priest. Many disappeared shortly
afterwards from the lower slopes of Parnassus,
not being of those dowered with the true call;
and so, one after the other, all are to be
accounted for. The genuine men of the
nineties after the fall of Wilde seem to have
migrated to Smithers’ wonderful bookshop in
Bond Street, where their later works were issued
in ornate editions.</p>

<p>The names of others besides the actual members
of the Rhymers’ Club must not be altogether
forgotten, such as Percy Hemingway with
his <cite>Happy Wanderer</cite>, Theodore Wratislaw,
Olive Custance, Dollie Radford, Rosamund
Marriott-Watson, Norman Gale, and many
others who were also of the movement. However,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83">83</a></span>
of them I cannot speak here, but can only
refer the reader to the book-lists of Elkin
Mathews and John Lane for the first period,
and of Leonard Smithers for the second. In
the numerous slim plaquettes of verse issued
from these presses he will find golden verse
worthy of the labour of his research. Indeed,
amid so many writers one is compelled to resort
to the odious necessity of a choice, so I shall
here all too briefly deal with <cite>Silverpoints</cite> as
a typical volume of the early period, and then
trace succinctly the career of two poets, who
had certainly the right to that appellation,
Ernest Dowson and John Davidson, and who
were both not only of, but actually were the
movement itself. Lastly, in this section, as an
indication of the wide influence these writers
had overseas, as in the case of the Birch Bark
School of Canada and certain poets in Australia,
I wish to mention the young American
poet who was an intimate of so many of the
men of the nineties&mdash;William Theodore Peters.</p>

<p>The narrow green octavo of <cite>Silverpoints</cite>,
with its lambent golden flames, strikes the eye
at once as some bizarre and exotic work. It
was one of the first of the limited éditions de
luxe that mark the new printing of the decade,
and is one of the most dainty little books ever
issued by Elkin Mathews and John Lane.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84">84</a></span>
Most of the titles are in French, and there are
imitations from Charles Baudelaire, Arthur
Rimbaud, Stéphane Mallarmé, Paul Verlaine&mdash;the
gods of the symbolist school at that
moment. Poems are dedicated (it was the
habit of the decade) to friends, including
Pierre Louÿs, Paul Verlaine, Oscar Wilde,
R.&nbsp;H. Sherard, Henri Teixeira de Mattos,
Ernest Dowson, etc. The predominant note is
that of tigress’s blood and tiger-lilies. Honey,
roses, white breasts, and golden hair, with
fierce passion and indolent languor, are
the chords of the book’s frisson. All the
panoply of the new English art begotten from
the French here burgeons forth with the Satanic
note that was then in the fashion. We find
this in the <cite>Femmes Damnées</cite>:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85">85</a></span>
There is more than an echo of Rimbaud’s
verses in this volume, and the poet is evidently
straining always after the violent effect, the
climacteric moment of a mood or passion. Probably
two of the most successfully carried
through crises are <cite>The Barber</cite> and <cite>Mishka</cite>.
The first of these as a typical example of the
whole school I venture to spheterize in full:</p>

<p>Here we have a long amorous catalogue. It
is the catalogue age which comes via Oscar
Wilde’s <cite>Sphinx</cite> and <cite>Salomé</cite> from certain French
writers. But this does not make up for the
singing power of the poet, and in long poems it
becomes singularly laborious. However, this
phase of poetry is so typical of the age that it
is as well to have dealt with it before turning
to the essentially ‘singing’ poets of the period,
Dowson and Davidson.</p>

<p>Indeed, there is no one in the nineties
worthier of the honourable title of poet than
Ernest Dowson. With his unsatisfied passion
for Adelaide in Soho; his cry for ‘madder music
and for stronger wine’; his æsthetic theories,
such as that the letter ‘v’ was the most<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87">87</a></span>
beautiful of the letters; his reverence for things
French, he has caused Mr. Symons, in one of
his most notable essays, to draw a delightful
portrait of a true <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">enfant de Bohême</i>. Robert
Harborough Sherard has also kept the Dowson
tradition up in his description of the death of
the vexed and torn spirit of the poet in his
<cite>Twenty Years in Paris</cite>, a work which contains
much interesting material for a study of the
nineties. But Victor Plarr, another poet of
the nineties, enraged at the incompleteness of
these pictures, has tried to give us in his reminiscences,
unpublished letters, and marginalia,
the other facet of Dowson&mdash;the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">poète intime</i>
known to few.</p>

<p>It is no question of ours, in a brief summary
like this, which is the truer portrait of
Dowson; whether he was or was not like Keats
in his personal appearance; whether Arthur
Moore and Dowson wrote alternate chapters
of <cite>A Comedy of Masks</cite>; whether in his last
days or not Leonard Smithers used to pay him
thirty shillings a week for all he could do;
whether he used to pray or not in front of the
bearded Virgin at Arques; whether he used to
drink hashish or not. All these problems are
outside the beauty of the lyric poetry of
Dowson; and it is by his poetry and not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88">88</a></span>
because of all these rumours around his brief
life that he will live.</p>

<p>He was the poet impressionist of momentary
emotions, and poetry with him was, as Stéphane
Mallarmé said, ‘the language of a crisis.’ Each
Dowson poem is more or less the feverish impression
of a hectical crisis. For in a way he
takes off where Keats ended, for Keats was
becoming a hectic, while Dowson started out
as one.</p>

</div>

<p>His earliest poem to attract attention was
<cite>Amor Umbratilis</cite>, which appeared in Horne’s
<cite>Century Guild Hobby Horse</cite>. It has the real
Dowson note, and marks him down at once as
one of those poets who are by nature <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">buveurs
de lune</i>. That was in 1891. In 1892 came
out the first book of the Rhymers’ Club, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89">89</a></span>
with six poems of Dowson in it he definitely
took his place in the movement. It is said
that the Oscar Wilde set sent him a telegram
shortly after this ‘peremptorily ordering him
to appear at the Café Royal to lunch with the
then great man.’ Dowson was flattered, and
might well be, for Wilde was a splendid judge
of good work.</p>

<p>Two years later the Club’s second book appeared,
and Dowson has again half a dozen
poems in it, including the lovely <cite>Extreme
Unction</cite>, and that rather doubtfully praised
lyric ‘<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">non sum qualis eram bonae sub regno
Cynarae</i>.’ Then in the same year as <cite>The
Savoy</cite> (1896) appeared his <cite>Verses</cite>, printed on
Japanese vellum and bound in parchment, with
a cover design in gold by Aubrey Beardsley&mdash;a
typical Smithers book. This volume contains
the best of Dowson, the handsel (if it is
not too big a phrase to use of such a delicate
and delightful artist), the handsel of his immortality.
For there is something about Dowson’s
best work, though so fragile in its texture, that
has the classic permanence of a latter-day
Propertius. He has a Latin brevity and clarity,
and he is at his best in this volume. Something
has vanished from the enchantment of
the singer in <cite>Decorations</cite> (1899). It is like the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90">90</a></span>
flowers of the night before. One feels that so
many of these later verses had been done perforce,
as Victor Plarr says, rather to keep on in
the movement lest one was forgotten. But in
1899 the movement was moribund, and the
winter of discontent for the Pierrots of the
nineties was fast closing down. Remembering
these things, one murmurs the sad beauty of
those perfect lines of this true poet in his first
volume:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When this, our rose, is faded,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And these, our days, are done,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In lands profoundly shaded<br /></span>
<span class="i2">From tempest and from sun:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah, once more come together,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Shall we forgive the past,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And safe from worldly weather<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Possess our souls at last.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Not without reason one feels he has been
called the ‘rosa rosarum of All the Nineties,’
in so far as poetry is concerned; but, personally,
I would prefer to call him, if one has
to call such a true poet anything, the poets’
poet of the nineties. The best of his short
stories rank high in the great mass of the
literature of those days, and are dealt with (together
with his partnership in two novels) in
another section. As for his little one-act play,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91">91</a></span>
<cite>The Pierrot of the Minute</cite>, one is apt to feel
perhaps that Beardsley was not over unjust to
it, when he described it as a tiresome playlet
he had to illustrate. At any rate, it was the
cause of Beardsley’s doing one or two admirable
decorations, even if the actual play, in
which the young American poet of the nineties,
Theodore Peters (of whom more anon), and
Beardsley’s own sister acted, was not effective
as a stage production.</p>

<p>There is no doubt but that Davidson, though
he was outside the coteries of the nineties, was
still of them. First of all he was a Scotchman
of evangelical extraction, and secondly he was
not an Oxford man. All this made him outside
the group. On the other count, he was of
the Rhymers’ Club, though he did not contribute
to the books. He was strongly influenced
by Nietzsche, though the French
influence in him was rather negative. His
books came from the Bodley Head and were
well recognised by its other members. Beardsley
even decorated some of them, and Rothenstein
did his portrait for <cite>The Yellow Book</cite>. In fact,
Davidson himself wrote for that periodical.
All this made him of the group. It would be
thus impossible to pass over such a poet in connection
with this movement, for Davidson has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92">92</a></span>
written some magnificent lyrics, if he has made
his testaments too often and too turgidly. The
Davidson, indeed, of the nineties will be discovered
to be, by any one examining his works,
the Davidson that will most probably survive.</p>

<p>He was born in 1857, but as Mr. Holbrook
Jackson admirably puts it, ‘John Davidson
did not show any distinctive <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fin de siècle</i>
characteristics until he produced his novel
<cite>Perfervid</cite><a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> in 1890.’ His next work, a volume
of poetry, which was the first to attract attention,
<cite>In a Music Hall and other Poems</cite> (1891),
accentuates these distinctive characteristics,
and fairly launches him on the tide of the
movement. Before that time he had been
school-mastering and clerking in Scotland,
while his leisure had begotten three rather ill-conceived
works. Davidson discovered himself
when he came to London to write. The
movement of the nineties stimulated him towards
artistic production, and when that
movement was killed by the fall of Wilde, and
buried by the Boer War, Davidson again lost
himself in the philosophic propaganda of his
last years before he was driven to suicide.
Philosophy, indeed, with John Davidson, was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93">93</a></span>
to eat one’s heart with resultant mental indigestion
that completely unbalanced the
artist in him. Therefore, so far as this appreciation
is concerned, we only have to deal
with the happy Davidson of the <cite>Ballads</cite> and
<cite>Fleet Street Eclogues</cite> fame; the gay writer of
<cite>A Random Itinerary</cite> (1894); the rather hopeless
novelist of <cite>Baptist Lake</cite> (1894), and <cite>The
Wonderful Mission of Earl Lavender</cite> (1895).
The last tedious phase before he gave himself
to the Cornish sea is no affair of ours. In his
<cite>Testament</cite> he says ‘none should outlive his
power,’ and realising probably that he had made
this mistake, he wished to end it all.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_16" href="#FNanchor_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> <cite>The Eighteen Nineties</cite>, by Holbrook Jackson, p. 215
1913.</p></div>

<p>But in the nineties he was like his own
birds, full of ‘oboe’ song and ‘broken music.’
Seldom has the English river, the Thames, been
more sweetly chaunted than by him. While
if we are looking for his kinship with his time
there is no doubt about it in <cite>The Ballad of a
Nun</cite>, who remarks:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I care not for my broken vow,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Though God should come in thunder soon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I am sister to the mountains now,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And sister to the sun and moon.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">A statement which we feel many of the
Beardsley ladies cadaverous with sin or fat
with luxury would have been quite capable of
repeating. Again, his <cite>Thirty Bob a Week</cite> in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94">94</a></span>
<cite>The Yellow Book</cite> is as much a ninety effort as his
<cite>Ballad of Hell</cite>, while his novel, <cite>Earl Lavender</cite>,
is a burlesque of certain of the eccentricities
of the period. In a poetical note to this
volume he sings:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oh! our age end style perplexes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All our Elders’ time has famed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On our sleeves we wear our sexes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our diseases, unashamed.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">The prevalent realistic disease in poetry is
well represented by <cite>A Woman and her Son</cite>:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He set his teeth, and saw his mother die,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Outside a city reveller’s tipsy tread<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Severed the silence with a jagged rent.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">Above all, Davidson handles with marked
facility the modern ballad medium of narrative
verse. <cite>The Ballad of a Nun</cite>, <cite>The Ballad
of an Artist’s Wife</cite>, and others, relate their
story in easy, jogging quatrains. As a sample
one can quote from <cite>A New Ballad of Tannhäuser</cite>:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">As he lay worshipping his bride,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">While rose leaves in her bosom fell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On dreams came sailing on a tide<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of sleep, he heard a matin bell.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘Hark! let us leave the magic hill,’<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He said, ‘and live on earth with men.’<br /></span>
<span class="i0">‘No, here,’ she said, ‘we stay until<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The Golden Age shall come again.’<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95">95</a></span>
But if Davidson could tell a tale in verse
it cannot be said he understood the novel form.
Although here it is rather noticeable that he
has a strange, unique feature among his contemporaries.
For he at least has a sense of
humour. Max Beerbohm, it is true, had the
gift of irony; but Davidson, almost alone, has
a certain vein of grim Scotch humour, as, for
example, in the character of little red-headed
Mortimer in <cite>Perfervid</cite>. In Dowson, Johnson,
Symons, and the others, one is sometimes
appalled by the seriousness of it all. Lastly,
but by no means least, Davidson occasionally
attains the lyric rapture of unadulterated
poetry in his shorter pieces, while his vignettes
of nature linger in the memory on
account of their truth and beauty. Both
these qualities&mdash;the lyric rapture and the
keen eye for country sights and sounds&mdash;are
to be found, for instance, in <cite>A Runnable
Stag</cite>:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When the pods went pop on the broom, green broom,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And apples began to be golden-skinned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We harboured a stag in the Priory coomb,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And we feathered his trail up wind, up wind!<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">Among many other ambitions, Davidson
wanted to fire the scientific world with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96">96</a></span>
imaginative poetry. As he phrased it: ‘Science
is still a valley of dead bones till imagination
breathes upon it.’ There are indeed
evidences of an almost Shelleyan pantheism
in his credo. Unhappy was his life, but,
probably, he did not labour in vain, for a
handsel of his song will endure. Writing, indeed,
was the consolation of his life:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I cannot write, I cannot think;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">’Tis half delight and half distress;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My memory stumbles on the brink<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of some unfathomed happiness&mdash;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Of some old happiness divine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What haunting scent, what haunting note,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What word, or what melodious line,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sends my heart throbbing to my throat?<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">Indeed, why repeat it, both Dowson and he
will live by their poetry. But in the case of
Davidson, in addition, there is his rather
elephantine humour. While again it must
always be remembered that he had the courage
to state that the fear of speaking freely had
‘cramped the literature of England for a
century.’ It was the liberty of the French
literature indeed that in no small degree
captivated the minds of all these young men.
Very few of them, however, had the courage to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97">97</a></span>
speak freely. But it must always remain to
Davidson’s credit that he tried to write a freer,
emancipated novel, which, however, he failed
to do, because he had a very remote idea of
novel construction.</p>

<p>It was in 1896 that the quaint little salmon-pink
volume of William Theodore Peters, the
young American poet, appeared, entitled <cite>Posies
out of Rings</cite>. This young American was an
intimate of some of the men of the nineties,
and though it is doubtful whether he himself
would have ever achieved high fame as a poet,
he had a sincere love for the beautiful things
of Art. Among all these tragedies of ill-health,
insanity and suicide that seemed to
track down each of these young men, his fate
was perhaps the saddest of all, for he died of
starvation in Paris,<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> where many of his verses
had appeared in a distinctly American venture,
<cite>The Quartier Latin</cite>. His volume of conceits
are a harking back, not always satisfactorily, to
the ancient form of the versified epigram.
What was wrong with his Muse is that it was
only half alive. He puts indeed his own case
in a nutshell in that charming little poem
<cite>Pierrot and the Statue</cite>, which I venture to
quote in full:</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_17" href="#FNanchor_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> R.&nbsp;H. Sherard, <cite>Twenty Years in Paris</cite>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98">98</a></span></p></div>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">One summer evening in a charméd wood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before a marble Venus, Pierrot stood;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A Venus beautiful beyond compare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gracious her lip, her snowy bosom bare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pierrot amorous, his cheeks aflame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Called the white statue many a lover’s name.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An oriole flew down from off a tree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">‘Woo not a goddess made of stone!’ sang he.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">‘All of my warmth to warm it,’ Pierrot said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When by the pedestal he sank down dead;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The statue faintly flushed, it seemed to strive<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To move&mdash;<em>but it was only half alive</em>.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">Such was the Muse’s response to Peters’ wooing;
while he, in that strange bohemian world of so
many of the young writers of that day, wrote in
another short poem the epitaph of the majority
of those who gave so recklessly of their youth,
only to fail. It is called <cite>To the Café aux
Phares de l’Ouest, Quartier Montparnasse</cite>:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The painted ship in the paste-board sea<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Sails night and day.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To-morrow it will be as far as it was yesterday.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">But underneath, in the Café,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The lusty crafts go down,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And one by one, poor mad souls drown&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While the painted ship in the paste-board sea<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Sails night and day.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">Such, indeed, was too often the fate of the
epigoni of the movement. Their nightingales<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99">99</a></span>
were never heard; they were buried with all
their songs still unsung.</p>

<p>The only other volume which Theodore
Peters essayed, to my knowledge, was a little
poetic one-acter like his friend Ernest Dowson’s
<cite>Pierrot of the Minute</cite> (for which work he wrote
an epilogue). Peters’ play, entitled <cite>The Tournament
of Love</cite>, is a very scarce item of the nineties’
bibliography. He calls it a pastoral masque
in one act, and it was published by Brentano’s
at Paris in 1894 and illustrated with drawings
by Alfred Jones. As Bantock wrote the music
for <cite>The Pierrot of the Minute</cite>, Noel Johnson
composed the melodies for <cite>The Tournament of
Love</cite>. The masque was put on at the Théâtre
d’Application (La Bodinière), 18 rue St. Lazare,
May 8, 1894. Peters himself took the part of
Bertrand de Roaix, a troubadour, while among
the cast were Wynford Dewhurst, the painter,
and Loïe Fuller, the dancer. The scene is an
almond orchard on the outskirts of Toulouse,
on the afternoon of the 3rd May, 1498. ‘A
group of troubadours discovered at the right of
the stage, seated upon a white semicircular
Renaissance bench, some tuning their instruments.
Other poets towards the back. A
laurel tree at the right centre. On the left
centre two heralds guard the entrance to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100">100</a></span>
lists.’ Pons d’Orange, the arrived poet, will
win at this tournament of love, the Eglantine
nouvelle, ‘that golden prize of wit.’ But it is
won by Bertrand de Roaix, who wants it not,
but the love of the institutress of this court of
love, ‘Clémence Isaure, the Primrose Queen of
Beauty.’ At his love protestations she laughs;
the troubadour goes outside the lists and stabs
himself. As he lies dying Clémence, clothed
in her white samite, powdered with silver fleur-de-lys
and edged with ermine, her dust-blonde
hair bound with a fillet of oak-leaves, comes
forth from the lists and finds her boy lover’s
body:</p>

<p class="in0"><span class="smcap">The</span> Victorian literary era was fecund in
essayists, and the last decade lived up to this
reputation. The forerunners of the essayists
of the nineties were obviously Walter Pater,
John Addington Symonds, Oscar Wilde with
his <cite>Intentions</cite> and Whistler in his <cite>Gentle Art</cite>.
Behind these there was a great mass of French
influence which, together with literary impressionism
as exemplified in such books as
Crackanthorpe’s <cite>Vignettes</cite>, was to give the
essay and the so-called study a new lease of
life. Indeed, what came out of the period
was not merely criticism as a useful broom
sweeping away the chaff from the wheat, but
criticism itself as a creative art, as Wilde
chose to call it; not merely dry-as-dust
records of plays and cities, and other affairs as
in guide manuals, but artistic impressions, in
some ways as vital as the objects themselves.
Mr. Arthur Symons, in particular, has given
us an abundance of this kind of work of
which I have already spoken. So did Lionel<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102">102</a></span>
Johnson and Mr. Max Beerbohm, to whom
I propose to allude here, and many others like
Mr. Bernard Shaw, who, though not of the
movement, moved alongside it on his own way,
and Mr. G.&nbsp;S. Street, in his <cite>Episodes</cite>, Richard
Le Gallienne, Arthur Galton, Francis Adams
in his <cite>Essays in Modernity</cite>, etc. etc. One has
only to turn over the magazines of the period
to find a band of writers, too numerous to
mention, who aided on the movement with
their pens. To cite one prominent example
alone, there was Grant Allen with his essay
on <cite>The New Hedonism</cite>. Here, however, I
must be content with a brief appreciative
glance at the works of the two writers I have
mentioned, who were both actually of and in
the movement itself. I have not here of set
purpose referred to the Henley essayists like
Charles Whibley. But the two men of the
nineties I have chosen to speak of here have
been selected in the way an essayist should be
selected nine times out of ten, that is to say,
because of his pleasing personality. These two
writers&mdash;particularly Max&mdash;are such individual
writers, yet they never offend. They are just
pleasant garrulous companions.</p>

<p>For those who care at all passionately for
the precious things of literature, the work of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103">103</a></span>
Lionel Johnson will always remain a cherished
and secluded nook. The man was a scholar,
a poet, and a critic, whose dominant note was
gracile lucidity. A friend writing of his personal
appearance at the time of his death
said, ‘Thin, pale, very delicate he looked,
with a twitching of the facial muscles, which
showed even at the age of twenty-four how
unfit was his physique to support the strain of
an abnormally nervous organization. Quick
and mouselike in his movements, reticent of
speech and low-voiced, he looked like some
old-fashioned child who had strayed by chance
into an assembly of men. But a child could
not have shown that inward smile of appreciative
humour, a little aloof, a little contemptuous
perhaps, that worked constantly
around his mouth. He never changed except
in the direction of a greater pallor and a
greater fragility.’</p>

<p>Cloistral mysticism was the key-chord of his
two volumes of poetry (1895 and 1897). In
some respects he seems to have strayed out
of the seventeenth century of Crashaw and
Herbert. His early training, no doubt, engendered
this aspect. After six years in the
grey Gothic school of Winchester he passed on
to New College, Oxford. Here he came under<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104">104</a></span>
the influence of Pater, and was charmed by
the latter’s then somewhat hieratic austerity.
A devout Irish Catholic, he was moved by
three themes: his old school, Oxford, and Ireland,
and to these he unfortunately too often
devoted his muse. After the quiet seclusion
of his Oxford years, on entering the vortex of
London literary life he found that the world
of wayfaring was a somewhat rough passage in
the mire for one so delicate. Out of the
struggle between his scholarly aspirations and
the cry of his time for life, more life, was
woven perhaps the finest of all his poems, <cite>The
Dark Angel</cite>:</p>

<div class="poem-container">

<p class="in0">Most of his poems are subjective, and the
majority have a certain stiffness of movement
of a priest laden with chasuble; but sometimes,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105">105</a></span>
however, as in <cite>Mystic and Cavalier</cite>,
or in the lines on the statue of Charles I
at Charing Cross, he writes with a winsome
charm and freedom of spirit:</p>

<div class="poem-container">

</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">Surely this poem has the proud note of
Henley! There is another trait in his verse,
which, in view of his essays, it is as well not
to pass over. Like William Watson, his
literary poems are pregnant with phrases of
rich criticism. He calls back the immortals
in a true bookman’s invocation hailing ‘opulent
Pindar,’ ‘the pure and perfect voice of
Gray,’ ‘pleasant and elegant and garrulous
Pliny’:</p>

<p>But we are here chiefly concerned with his
prose writings. If it is the duty of the
essayist to mirror the intellectuality of his
age, Lionel Johnson was a mirror for the
Oxford standpoint of the nineties. There<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106">106</a></span>
still remain many of his papers uncollected
in various old newspaper files. But certainly
the best of his work has been lovingly collected
by friendly hands, and worthily housed in
<cite>Post Liminium</cite>. Take, for instance, this
passage from an essay on books published
originally in <cite>The Academy</cite> (December 8th,
1900):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The glowing of my companionable fire upon
the backs of my companionable books, and then
the familiar difficulty of choice. Compassed
about by old friends, whose virtues and vices
I know better than my own, I will be loyal to
loves that are not of yesterday. New poems,
new essays, new stories, new lives, are not my
company at Christmastide, but the never-ageing
old. ‘My days among the dead are passed.’
Veracious Southey, how cruel a lie! My sole
days among the dead are the days passed among
the still-born or moribund moderns, not the white
days and shining nights free for the strong voices
of the ancients in fame. A classic has a permanence
of pleasurability; that is the meaning of
his estate and title.</p></blockquote>

<p>Or again, Johnson in his paper on <cite>The
Work of Mr. Pater</cite>, sets forth perhaps the
best appreciation of his master that has yet
appeared:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘Magica sympathiæ!’ words borne upon the
shield of Lord Herbert of Cherbury, are inscribed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107">107</a></span>
upon the writings of Mr. Pater, who found his
way straight from the first to those matters
proper to his genius, nor did he, as Fuseli says of
Leonardo, ‘waste life, insatiate in experiment.’...
‘Nemo perfectus est,’ says St. Bernard, ‘qui
perfectior esse appetit’: it is as true in art as in
religion. In art also ‘the way to perfection is
through a series of disgusts’ ... and truly, as
Joubert said, we should hesitate before we differ
in religion from the saints, in poetry from the
poets.... There is no languorous toying with
things of beauty, in a kind of opiate dream, to be
found here.</p></blockquote>

<p>While Symons has written on all the arts,
the sphere of Johnson has been more limited to
traditional English lines. Johnson attempts
no broad æsthetical system like the former.
All that he does is to illuminate the writer
of whom he is speaking. And his little essays,
eminent in their un-English lucidity, their
scrupulous nicety, their conscious and deliberate
beauty, adding to our <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">belles lettres</i> a
classical execution and finish (which perfection
accounts perhaps for the classical smallness of
his bookmaking) have all the bewildering
charm of a born stylist. Certain of his
phrases linger in the mind like music. ‘Many
a sad half-murmured thought of Pascal, many
a deep and plangent utterance of Lucretius.’
Or the line: ‘The face whose changes dominate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108">108</a></span>
my heart.’ Like the styles of Newman
and Pater, on which his own is founded, he
is singularly allusive. He cites critics by
chapter and verse like an advocate defending
a case. In fact, as in his critical <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">magnum
opus</i>, <cite>The Art of Thomas Hardy</cite>, he is
amazingly judicial. It is, too, since he is
essentially academic, to the older critics he
prefers to turn for guidance. As he writes:
‘Flaubert and Baudelaire and Gautier, Hennequin
and M. Zola and M. Mallarmé, with all
their colleagues or exponents, may sometimes
be set aside, and suffer us to hear Quintilian
or Ben Jonson, Cicero or Dryden.’ This habit
sometimes makes him strenuous reading, particularly
in longer criticisms like <cite>The Art of
Thomas Hardy</cite>.</p>

<p>We grow weary of all this quotative authority.
Burton’s <cite>Anatomy of Melancholy</cite> cannot be
brought into every-day literary criticism. We
want to hear more of Lionel Johnson’s own
direct opinions and less of these selected passages
from his library. So it is to those passages
where Johnson is most himself we turn in
<cite>The Art of Thomas Hardy</cite>, which, in spite of
its academicism and the youthfulness of its
author, remains a genuine piece of sound
critical work. The delightful imagery of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109">109</a></span>
prose in such passages is often very illuminating,
as in this paragraph:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>From long and frequent converse with works of
any favourite author, we often grow to thinking
of them under some symbol or image; to see them
summed up and expressed in some one composite
scene of our own making; this is my ‘vision’ of
Mr. Hardy’s works. A rolling down country,
crossed by a Roman road; here a gray standing
stone, of what sacrificial ritual origin I can but
guess; there a grassy barrow, with its great
bones, its red-brown jars, its rude gold ornament,
still safe in earth; a broad sky burning with stars;
a solitary man. It is of no use to turn away, and
to think of the village farms and cottages, with
their antique ways and looks; of the deep woods,
of the fall of the woodman’s axe, the stir of the
wind in the branches; of the rustic feasts and festivals,
when the home-brewed drink goes round,
to the loosening of tongues and wits; of the hot
meadows, fragrant hayfields, cool dairies, and
blazing gardens; of shining cart-horses under the
chestnut-trees and cows called in at milking time:
they are characteristic scenes, but not the one
characteristic scene. That is the great down by
night, with its dead in their ancient graves, and its
lonely living figure; ...</p></blockquote>

<p>There is, perhaps, a reek about it all of a
too-conscious imitation of Pater’s murmured
obituaries which makes one in the end rather
tired of this hieratic treatment of art, so that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110">110</a></span>
one turns rather gladly to the one or two
tales he wrote. For example in <cite>The Lilies of
France</cite>, an episode of French anti-clericalism,
which appeared in <cite>The Pageant</cite>, 1897, he
slowly builds up a thing of verbal beauty
that one feels was actually worthy of him,
while in the previous number of the same
quarterly he perpetrated a delightful ironism on
the literary men of his period entitled <cite>Incurable</cite>,
in which, perhaps, we may trace faint autobiographical
clues. Such, briefly, was the work of
this young man who was found dead in Fleet
Street early one morning, aged thirty-five.</p>

<p>But the writer who was to bring irony in
English literature to a consummate pitch, and
add to the age a strange brief brilliance of
his own wilful spirit, was Max Beerbohm. Max,
the ‘Incomparable’ as Bernard Shaw once
described him, is the charm of the gilded lily,
the fairy prince of an urbane artificiality: he is
in literature what the cocktail is among drinks;
he is the enemy of dullness and the friend of that
Greek quality called ‘charis.’ He is the public
school and Varsity man who is fond of, but
afraid of, being tedious in literature; so with
delightful affectation his vehicle is persiflage
with a load of wit he pretends to disdain.
Of all the prose writers of the Beardsley<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111">111</a></span>
period he is the easiest and most charming
to read. In fact, he is the ideal essayist.
He titillates the literary sense. Fortunately
his glass is small, for if one had to drink it in
quart pots the result would be as disastrous as
in his one and only mistake&mdash;the long novel
<cite>Zuleika Dobson</cite>, which is a late work written
long after the nineties had been swallowed up
by that maw which swallowed up Lesbia’s
sparrow and all other beautiful dead things.</p>

<p>Max said in jest, ‘I belong to the Beardsley
period,’ and it is one of those jests which is only
too painfully true. When he was at Oxford he was
caught up in the movement, and wrote, under
Wilde’s influence, <cite>A Defence of Cosmetics</cite> for
the first number of <cite>The Yellow Book</cite>, and he
also appeared in Lord Alfred Douglas’s magazine.
Thenceforward he contributed to various
quarterlies, while in 1896 the little red volume
with its white paper label appeared as <cite>The
Works</cite>, containing all the best of this precocious
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">enfant terrible</i> of literature, who assures
us that he read in bed, while at school, <cite>Marius
the Epicurean</cite>, and found it not nearly so difficult
as <cite>Midshipman Easy</cite>. At the age of
twenty-five he cries: ‘I shall write no more.
Already I feel myself to be a trifle outmoded,’
and he religiously does not keep his word. He<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112">112</a></span>
keeps pouring out caricatures, writes <cite>More</cite>, the
companion volume to <cite>The Works</cite>, and perpetrates
his short story <cite>The Happy Hypocrite</cite>.
Beyond 1899 we cannot follow him, but he has
been busy ever since with his parodies, his <cite>Yet
Again</cite>, his lamentable novel, his one-act play,
and so on.</p>

<p>It is to that Beardsley period to which he
said he belonged we are here restricted. And
it must be admitted that though the Boer War
and the Great War do not seem to have gagged
him, there is something so impishly impudent
in his earlier work which renders it more remarkable
than the complacent efforts of his
later years.</p>

<p>Amid the searching seriousness of the
nineties, Max is like balm in Gilead. He
has the infinite blessing of irony. The others,
except Beardsley (who too has this gift), are so
appallingly serious. The French influences
that went to their making seem to have killed
the valiant English humour of Falstaff, Pickwick,
and Verdant Green. They are all like young
priests who will take no liberty with their
ritual; but Max saves the period with his
whimsical irony. His is not the fearful, mordant
irony of Octave Mirbeau, but a dainty
butterfly fancy playing lightly over the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113">113</a></span>
pleasures of a pleasant life. To be essentially
civilised is to be like a god. This is the pose
of such a mentality. It is a winsome pose
with no sharp edges to it, just as the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">poseur</i>
himself must be wilfully blind to all the
seaminess of life. In front of his window (if
a temperament be a window looking out on
life) there is a pleasant garden. Beyond is the
noise and dust of the highway. He is the
dandy in his choice of life as in his choice of
literature, and in more than one sense he has
written the happiest essays of the period.</p>

<p>It has been said his caricatures are essays.
May we not equally say his essays are caricatures?
The essay, indeed, is the work of the
feline male, the man who sits beside the fire
like Charles Lamb. The out-of-doors man
writes the episode. But Max is essentially an
indoors man, who has a perfect little dressing-room
like a lady’s boudoir, but much neater,
where he concocts his essays we read so easily
by infinite labour, with a jewelled pen. It is
as though he had said: ‘Literature must either
be amusing or dull; mine shall be the former.’
He is very much the young man about town
who has consented gracefully to come and charm
us. What he wrote of Whistler in <cite>The Gentle
Art of Making Enemies</cite>, we may say of him:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114">114</a></span>
‘His style never falters. The silhouette of no
sentence is ever blurred. Every sentence is
ringing with a clear, vocal cadence.’ And the
refrain is Max himself all the time, and his
personality is so likeable we stomach it all the
time. It is the note that vibrates through all
his amiable satiric irony, whether it be on the
House of Commons Manner or in defence of
the use of Cosmetics, or in describing the period
of 1880. Everything, from first to last, is done
with such good taste. Even in his wildest
flights of raillery he is utterly purposed not to
offend. In his charming paper, <cite>1880</cite>, he has
given us a vigorous vignette of the previous
decade to <cite>The Yellow Book</cite> age. One can
hardly help quoting a small passage here from
this admirably worked up prose: ‘In fact
Beauty had existed long before 1880. It was
Mr. Oscar Wilde who managed her début. To
study the period is to admit that to him was
due no small part of the social vogue that
Beauty began to enjoy. Fired by his fervid
words, men and women hurled their mahogany
into the streets and ransacked the curio-shops
for the furniture of Annish days. Dadoes
arose upon every wall, sunflowers and the
feathers of peacocks curved in every corner,
tea grew quite cold while the guests were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115">115</a></span>
praising the Willow Pattern of its cup. A
few fashionable women even dressed themselves
in sinuous draperies and unheard-of greens.
Into whatsoever ball-room you went, you would
surely find, among the women in tiaras, and
the fops and the distinguished foreigners, half
a score of comely ragamuffins in velveteen,
murmuring sonnets, posturing, waving their
hands. Beauty was sought in the most unlikely
places. Young painters found her
mobbled in the fogs, and bank-clerks versed
in the writings of Mr. Hamerton, were heard
to declare, as they sped home from the city,
that the Underground Railway was beautiful
from London Bridge to Westminster,
but not from Sloane Square to Notting Hill
Gate.’</p>

<p>It is thus that Max can play with a chord of
almost tender irony on his subject, and such a
style, so full of the writer’s personality, has the
cachet of the veritable essayist. How charmingly,
for example, he records his reminiscences
of Beardsley. It is a delightful little picture
of the artist, interesting enough to place beside
Arthur Symons’s portrait: ‘He loved dining
out, and, in fact, gaiety of any kind. His
restlessness was, I suppose, one of the symptoms
of his malady. He was always most content<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116">116</a></span>
where there was the greatest noise and bustle,
the largest number of people, and the most
brilliant light. The “domino-room” at the
Café Royal had always a great fascination for
him: he liked the mirrors and the florid gilding,
the little parties of foreigners, and the
smoke and the clatter of the dominoes being
shuffled on the marble tables.... I remember,
also, very clearly, a supper at which Beardsley
was present. After the supper we sat up rather
late. He was the life and soul of the party,
till, quite suddenly almost in the middle of a
sentence, he fell fast asleep in his chair. He
had overstrained his vitality, and it had all left
him. I can see him now as he sat there with
his head sunk on his breast; the thin face,
white as the gardenia in his coat, and the prominent,
harshly-cut features; the hair, that
always covered his whole forehead in a fringe
and was of so curious a colour&mdash;a kind of
tortoise-shell; the narrow, angular figure,
and the long hands that were so full of
power.’<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_18" href="#FNanchor_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> <cite>The Idler</cite>, May, 1898.</p></div>

<p>Outside this medium of the essay, with the
exception of the caricatures, Max is no longer
the incomparable, for his short story, <cite>The
Happy Hypocrite</cite>, is not a short story at all,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117">117</a></span>
but a spoilt essay;<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> while his novel is not
merely a failure, but a veritable disaster. With
his first paper in <cite>The Yellow Book</cite> he fell in
with the step of the men of the nineties, and
he too became a part of their efflorescence.
Sufficient unto that time is his work, and with
a final quotation from this early paper so redolent
of the movement that there is no
mistaking it, we must leave him and his future
on the knees of the gods: ‘Was it not at
Capua that they had a whole street where
nothing was sold but dyes and unguents? We
must have such a street, and, to fill our new
Seplosia, our Arcade of Unguents, all herbs
and minerals and live creatures shall give of
their substance. The white cliffs of Albion
shall be ground to powder for Loveliness, and
perfumed by the ghost of many a little violet.
The fluffy eider-ducks, that are swimming
round the pond, shall lose their feathers, that
the powder-puff may be moonlike as it passes
over Loveliness’ lovely face.’</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_19" href="#FNanchor_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> His Children’s Tale, <cite>The Small Boy and the Barley

another case of shipwrecked ingenuity.</p></div>

<p class="in0"><span class="smcap">Here</span> I propose to go through a litany of some
of my omissions. In essaying to depict the
aspects of an age there is always this pitfall,
omission, which ambuscades the adventurous
spirit. For we who know so little even about
ourselves&mdash;how can we, without grave impertinence,
boldly say I wish to bring back to the
mind of others an age dead and gone? Everything
is so interwoven in life that it is, for
example, an unwarranted arbitrariness to discuss
the literature of this period without
brooding on the black and white art of the
time, or the canvases of its painters.</p>

<p>I have worried for some space over Aubrey
Beardsley, but I have not spoken of men like
Mr. S.&nbsp;H. Sime, whose work Beardsley so delighted
in. Probably Sidney H. Sime’s work
in <cite>The Butterfly</cite>, <cite>The Idler</cite>, <cite>Pick-me-Up</cite>, <cite>Eureka</cite>,
etc., besides his book illustrations, is in some
ways the most powerfully imaginative of the
period. There has been a Beardsley craze,
and most assuredly there will be one day a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119">119</a></span>
Sime craze, when collectors have focussed properly
the marvellous suggestive power of this
artist’s work. Unfortunately, scattered up and
down old magazines, much of this work is, as it
were, lost for the moment like Toulouse Lautrec’s
drawings in papers like <cite>Le Rire</cite>. But when it
is garnered up in a worthy book of drawings
like the Beardsley books, the power of Sime’s
work will be undoubted. Fortunately Sime is
still amongst us, and occasionally a Dunsany
book brings us fresh evidence of his genius.</p>

<p>Again, I have not alluded to Edgar Wilson’s
bizarre and fascinating decorations of submarine
life and Japonesque figures. Like Shannon,
Ricketts, Raven Hill, and others, he received
his early art education at the Lambeth School
of Art. At the end of the eighties he began
collecting Japanese prints long before Beardsley
had left school. In fact, Edgar Wilson was
one of the pioneers of the Japanese print in
this country&mdash;a love for the strange which
came over to England from France. A typical
decorative design of Wilson’s<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> is ‘In the
Depths of the Sea,’ representing an octopus
rampant over a human skull, beneath which
are two strange flat fish, and in the background<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120">120</a></span>
a sunken old three-decker with quaintly carved
stern and glorious prow. <cite>Pick-me-Up</cite> first
used his work as it did that of many another
young artist, and in its back files much of his
best work can be found. For <cite>The Rambler</cite> he
did different designs for each issue, which is
probably the only redeeming feature about that
early Harmsworth periodical. <cite>The Sketch</cite>,
<cite>Cassell’s</cite>, <cite>Scribner’s</cite>, and above all <cite>The Idler</cite> and
<cite>The Butterfly</cite>, are beautified among other
papers by his exotic decorations.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_20" href="#FNanchor_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> <cite>Edgar Wilson and his Work</cite>, by Arthur Lawrence,
<cite>The Idler</cite>, July, 1899.</p></div>

<p>Once more I have not spoken at all of Miss
Althea Gyles’s hectic visions which, in her illustrations
for Wilde’s <cite>The Harlot’s House</cite>, probably
reached the acme of the period’s realisation
of the weird. She is of course really of the
Irish symbolists, and not one of the nineties’
group at all; but, in her Wilde illustrations,
she almost enters the same field as the men of
the nineties. Her connection, too, with the
firm of Smithers is another strong excuse for
mentioning her work here. In <cite>The Dome</cite> both
her drawings and poems appeared, while in the
December number for 1898 there is a note on
her symbolism by W.&nbsp;B. Yeats. In all her
drawings the fancy that seems to have such free
flight is in reality severely ordered by the
designer’s symbolism. Sometimes it is merely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121">121</a></span>
intriguing, as in drawings like ‘The Rose of
God,’ where a naked woman is spread-eagled
against the clouds above a fleet of ships and
walled city, while in other designs the symbolism
is full of suggestive loveliness, as in ‘Noah’s
Raven.’ ‘The Ark floats upon a grey sea
under a grey sky, and the raven flutters above
the sea. A sea nymph, whose slender swaying
body drifting among the grey waters is a perfect
symbol of the soul untouched by God or
by passion, coils the fingers of one hand about
his feet and offers him a ring, while her other
hand holds a shining rose under the sea.
Grotesque shapes of little fishes flit about the
rose, and grotesque shapes of larger fishes swim
hither and thither. Sea nymphs swim through
the windows of a sunken town, and reach
towards the rose hands covered with rings; and
a vague twilight hangs over all.’ This is explained
to represent the search of man for the
fleshly beauty which is so full of illusions for us
all, while the spiritual beauty is ever far away.
To this kind of interpretative design Oscar
Wilde’s swan song, <em>The Harlot’s House</em>, lends
itself admirably, and Miss Gyles’s black and
white work here becomes inspired to the
standard of Beardsley’s and Sime’s best work.

in its shadow-graphic use of masses of black on
a white ground.</p>

<p>Once more, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">mea culpa</i>, I have paid scant attention
to Max Beerbohm’s caricatures, and I
have failed to call attention here to his earlier
and later method of work. I have not even
spoken of his little paper entitled <cite>The Spirit of
Caricature</cite>, wherein he discusses the spirit of
the art he practises. God forgive me! Or yet
again what meed of homage have I yet rendered
to Mr. Will Rothenstein’s lithographic portraits,
which are absolutely a necessity to anyone who
would live a while with the shades of these men.
Take, for example, his <cite>Liber Juniorum</cite>, which
alone contains lithographed drawings of Aubrey
Beardsley, Max Beerbohm, and Arthur Symons.
Then there are so many others over whose<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123">123</a></span>
achievements I must keep a holy silence, such
as Mr. Charles Ricketts and his <cite>Dial</cite>, which was
published by the Vale Press, and to which John
Gray contributed many poems.</p>

<p>Again, there are the colourists of this group,
particularly Walter Sickert and Charles Conder.
The latter, above all, is the colour comrade to
Beardsley’s black and white. His figures are
the lovers of Dowson’s verse, his landscapes and
world have all those memories of the golden
time that haunt the brain of John Gray and
Theodore Wratislaw. No note, however short,
on the nineties would be complete without a
halt for praise of this painter of a strangely
coloured <i xml:lang="it" lang="it">dolce far niente</i>. For everything in
his work, be it on canvas, silk panel, or dainty
fan, is drowsy with the glory of colour (as Mr.
Holbrook Jackson admirably says), ‘colour
suggesting form, suggesting all corporeal
things, suggesting even itself, for Conder
never more than hints at the vivid possibilities
of life, more than a hint might waken his
puppets from their Laodicean dream.’</p>

<p>Whether an idyllic landscape or a fantastic
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bal masqué</i> of Montmartre or an Elysian <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fête
galante</i> was his theme, the work itself is
always permeated with the spirit of Conder.
His nude figure ‘Pearl,’ his ‘L’Oiseau Bleu,’
his ‘Femme dans une loge au théâtre,’ are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124">124</a></span>
typical of his successful achievements. The
‘Fickle Love’ fan is but one of the numerous
exquisite works he produced in this branch
of art; while ‘The Masquerade’ is the work of
a Beardsley-like fancy which could colour like
Conder.</p>

<p>Like his personality, his work suffered from
certain unhappy moods, and that is what
makes so much of it uneven. Born in 1868,
a descendant of Louis Francis Roubiliac, the
famous sculptor, whose work for the figures
of our eighteenth century porcelain factories is
so well known, of Conder it may be said, as of
all artists with French blood in them, when he
is successful he is irresistible. He might not be
able to draw modern men, but how beautifully he
drew the women of his day can be seen in ‘La
Toilette.’ He delighted, indeed, in designing
women wandering in dream gardens, in painting
roses and Princes Charming.</p>

<p>It would be pleasant to travel through this
world of delightful dreams, were we not restricted
of set purpose to the literary side of
the movement. And has it not already been
done in Mr. Frank Gibson’s <cite>Charles Conder</cite>?</p>

<p>Again, some of the publishers who produced
the books of these men have their right to
something more than scant mention. To Mr.
Elkin Mathews, particularly as the first publisher<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125">125</a></span>
of the Rhymers’ Club books and as the
issuer of John Gray’s first volume of poetry,
bibliophiles owe a debt of gratitude. In the
early days of the nineties Mr. John Lane
became associated with him, until the autumn
of 1894 witnessed ‘Parnassus divided into
two peaks.’ Later, after the Wilde débâcle,
an extraordinary figure, worthy of a romance,
in the person of the late Leonard Smithers,
who was at one time in the legal profession
at Sheffield, took the field as a publisher by
way of H.&nbsp;S. Nichols. He was no mere publisher
but a man of considerable scholarship,
who not only issued but finished the Sir Richard
Burton translation of Catullus. Round him,
to a considerable extent, the vanishing group
rallied for a little while before Death smote
them one by one. Here is no place to pay
due justice to this amiable Benvenuto Cellini
of book printing himself, but it must be remembered
his figure bulks largely in the closing
scenes. He kept Dowson from starvation.
Beardsley wrote of him as ‘our publisher.’<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a>
He, when others failed, had the courage to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126">126</a></span>
launch on the English publishing market the
released Wilde’s now famous <cite>Ballad of Reading
Gaol</cite>. If he did exceed certain rules for himself,
he at least took risks to help others. He
was no supine battener on the profits of books
for young ladies’ seminaries. He was a printer,
and his bankruptcy may be said to have closed
the period.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_21" href="#FNanchor_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> It is interesting that in an unpublished letter of
Beardsley’s to Smithers when the latter was intending
to produce <cite>The Peacock</cite>, an unpublished quarterly,
Beardsley promises him his best work.</p></div>

<p>Lastly in this chaunt of omissions comes the
drama of the nineties. Unfortunately the
drama, in so far as it affects the group of
the nineties with which we are concerned,
is almost a nullity. Aubrey Beardsley once
commenced a play, which was never heard of,
in collaboration with Brandon Thomas.
Ernest Dowson wrote what Beardsley called
a ‘tiresome’ playlet. John Davidson perpetrated
a number of plays such as <cite>Bruce</cite> (1886),
<cite>Smith, a tragic farce</cite> (1888), <cite>Scaramouch in
Naxos</cite>, and two other plays in 1889 when
he was feeling his way, and translated much
later as hackwork a play of François Coppée’s
and Victor Hugo’s <cite>Ruy Blas</cite>. Theodore Peters’
pastoral and other similar trifles only go to
show how barren the group itself was in the
dramatist’s talent. Nor can much be said for
such poetic plays as Theodore Wratislaw’s <cite>The
Pity of Love</cite>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127">127</a></span>
But it must be remembered, as a matter of
fact, such a sweeping conclusion may not only
be unjust but even impertinent. For where
in all the theatres of the London of the
nineties would the plays (if they had been
written) of these young men have found a
home? Probably the dramatic output of the
nineties was nil because there were no small
theatres in London at that date of the type to
give these young men a hope that any works
they might write could be produced. So only
at the end of the decade do we see the
dramatic outburst when the Irish movement
founded a theatre of its own and produced
J.&nbsp;M. Synge, and also when Miss Horniman
gave Manchester a repertory theatre, and then
Stanley Houghton came.</p>

<p>True, at the same period as the nineties
Oscar Wilde was producing plays burlesquing
the world of Society, and Bernard Shaw was
getting ready to launch his own works by
bombasting every one else’s; but the little
movement of the younger men remained
dramatically dumb. Nothing came even when
George Moore produced <cite>The Strike at Arlingford</cite>
and John Todhunter <cite>The Black Cat</cite>. It
is a hard thing to believe that all these young
men were devoid of the dramatic instinct. I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128">128</a></span>
prefer for my part to blame the London
theatrical world for the lack of those minute
theatres which have become so much a part of
the night life of big continental cities and are
so admirably adapted for the production of the
works of new dramatists.</p>

<p>Indeed, the theatrical atmosphere of London
at that time was in its usual perpetual state
of stuffiness. There was not even a beneficent
society then such as we now have in the
Pioneer Players, whose theatre (if one may so
symbolise it) is the charity house for emancipated
dramatists. Ibsen’s <cite>Doll’s House</cite> had
been produced in London just before the
nineties’ epoch began, and, like anything new in
popular art over here, raised the hue-and-cry.
Then, too, the big ‘star’ curse, which Wilde
himself so justly spurned, was permanently
settled on our own insular drama like a stranglehold
on the author.</p>

<p>Outside England, in the big art world of the
continent, Schnitzler was beginning in Vienna.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a>
Maurice Maeterlinck, in Belgium, had begun<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a>
too the drama of expressive silences which
came to light in Paris. There were Sudermann
and Hauptmann in Germany; Echegaray
in Spain; D’Annunzio in Italy; Ibsen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129">129</a></span>
and Björnstjerne Björnson finishing their work
for the Scandinavian drama; while the playwrights
of Paris were, as always, feverishly
fabricating all sorts of movements, as when
Paul Fort, a boy of eighteen, founds in
1890 the Théâtre d’Art. But what was going
on in England? Pinero’s <cite>The Second Mrs.
Tanqueray</cite>, Wilde’s <cite>Salomé</cite>, and his light
comedies, together with stuff by Henry Arthur
Jones, Sydney Grundy, etc., represented the
serious drama. The critics were perturbed, as
they generally are. The musical comedy and
its singing, pirouetting soubrettes deluded the
populace into the belief that it had a great
drama, when all these spectacles should really
have been housed in London in spacious tearooms
for the benefit of that multitude which is
fond of tinkling melody and teapots. There was
not even in London a single Überbrettlbuhnen,
as the Germans mouth it, where those who love
beer could go to hear poets recite their verse
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">à la</i> Otto Bierbaum, let alone little theatres
where what we so dolefully term the serious
drama could be played.</p>

<p>Even, too, in those days, the newspaper
critics, muzzled by the business department,
which has never any wish to lose its theatrical
advertisements, said little, with a few honest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130">130</a></span>
exceptions like Bernard Shaw. Max Beerbohm,
when he took over the critical work of
Shaw on <cite>The Saturday Review</cite> was obviously
unhappy. English theatres rapidly became as
elaborate and as pompous as the Church Militant
in its palmy days. They kept growing
in size. In London, indeed, the small theatre
never had its boom. Indeed, the nineties was
the age when the big theatres were being built
to fill their owners’ pockets and the men of the
nineties themselves (be it for whatever reason
you like) did not produce a single play.</p>

<h2><a id="EPILOGUE"></a>EPILOGUE</h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="smcap">It</span> all seems a long time ago now since those
days when Verlaine was as a lantern for these
young men’s feet, to guide them through the
mazes of Art. Thirty years ago and more
Wilde was disclosing ‘décolleté spirits of
astonishing conversation’; Zola influenced that
Byron of pessimism, Thomas Hardy, to beget
<cite>Jude the Obscure</cite> (1895), and when the critics
assailed him the Wessex giant guarded a ‘holy
silence’ which has denied us up till now an
emancipated novel such as the French and
Italians have, though James Joyce may yet
achieve it for us. It was also the age of youth
in hansom cabs looking out on the lights of
London’s West End which spread out before
them as in a ‘huge black velvet flower.’ Ibsen,
Tolstoy, Maeterlinck, Nietzsche, D’Annunzio,
and Dostoievsky were beginning to percolate
through by means of translations that opened
out a new world into which everybody hastily
swarmed. It was an age in which young men<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132">132</a></span>
frankly lauded the value of egoism. Indeed,
it was essentially the age of young men. In
those days a genital restiveness which came
over from France started the sex equation. A
hothouse fragrance swept across the pudibond
wastes of our literature. Hectics came glorying
in their experiences. Richard of the Golden
Girl with his banjo lifts up his voice to chaunt
‘a bruisèd daffodil of last night’s sin.’ Women
like George Egerton in her <cite>Keynotes</cite> take
questions further than Mrs. Lynn Linton had
ever done in the previous decade. Exoticism,
often vulgar when not in master hands, blabbed
out its secrets in works like <cite>The Woman who Did</cite>.
Confounding the good with the bad, a wail
went up against the so-called gospel of intensity.
Sometimes it was in the serious
reviews and weeklies; at another time it was
Harry Quilter. Some young undergraduates
at Oxford, even in <cite>Aristophanes at Oxford</cite>
(May, 1894), were filled with ‘an honest dislike
for <cite>Dorian Gray</cite>, <cite>Salomé</cite>, <cite>The Yellow Book</cite>, and
the whole of the lackadaisical, opium-cigarette
literature of the day.’ <cite>Punch</cite> produced a
Beardsley Britannia and sang of:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133">133</a></span></p><div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The Yellow Poster girl looked out<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Her bang was cut uneven.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She had three fingers on one hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the hairs on her head were seven.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">And all these criticisms now, all these quarrels,
are like old spent battlefields the sands of
gracious time have covered over and hidden
from view. Alone the best work of the period
remains; for good art has no period or special
vogue.</p>

<p>Indeed, the elements that destroy the worthless,
that winnow the chaff from the grain,
have been at work. For us, indeed, this landscape
has changed from what it once was, and
looking at it now we acquire a new impression
which was denied to the critics of the age
itself. Some of us, without a doubt, have
gone to the opposite extreme and prattle about
it as an age of platitudes, and accuse a work of
art of being as old as <cite>The Yellow Book</cite>. One
might as well accuse a violet of being as old as
the Greek Anthology. For always, to those
wandering back in the right spirit to those
days, there will come something of the infinite
zest which stirred the being of the men of the
nineties to create art. It was such an honest
effort that one has to think of those times when
Marlowe and his colleagues were athrob with
æsthetic aspiration to find a similitude. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134">134</a></span>
nineties, indeed, are a pleasant flower-garden in
our literature over which many strange perfumes
float. There are times when one wishes
to retreat into such places, as there are moments
when the backwaters enchant us from the main
stream.</p>

<p>It has been said it was an age of nerves. If by
this is implied a keener sensitiveness to certain
feelings pulsating in the art of this movement,
one will not have very far to go to find its
cause in the French impressionistic school of
Manet, which, after saturating all types of
French artists, undoubtedly invaded writers
over here even before the movement of the
nineties began. On the age without a doubt it
had a lasting influence, so that to a certain
degree, without being over-busy with what went
before, we may say its writers brought it to no
small degree into common use in our literature.
But just as impressionism in painting had
existed centuries before in the ever-busy mind
of men like Leonardo da Vinci, one cannot go
so far as to say it had never existed before
in our literature. Such a statement would be
perhaps frivolous. But it was with these men
it first came to exist as a kind of cry of a
new clan. It was these men who were essentially
hectics who essayed to etch the exotic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135">135</a></span>
impression. The majority of the work of the
movement, in fact, can be described as impressionisms
of the abnormal by a group of
individualists. For in all their work the predominant
keynote will be found to be a keen
sense of that strangeness of proportion which
Bacon noted as a characteristic of what he
called beauty. It is observable as much in
the poems of Dowson as in the drawings of
Beardsley, two of the leading types of the
movement. It vibrates intensely in the minor
work of men like Wratislaw, and also in John
Gray’s early volume, as I have endeavoured
to show. All Mr. Arthur Symons’s criticism
is a narration of his soul’s adventures in quest
of it. It stirred the genius of Charles Conder,
and vitalizes the rather cruel analysis of
Hubert Crackanthorpe. We see it almost as
the animating spirit of the age itself in Oscar
Wilde’s poems, <cite>The Sphinx</cite> and <cite>The Harlot’s
House</cite>. It has become disseminated like a
perfume from the writings of Pater in the men
who came after him. It was, so to speak, a
quickening stimulus to them as the rediscovery
of a manuscript of Catullus, or a Greek figure
was in the years of the Renaissance itself.
With it came a sense of freedom. An attempt
was made, because of it, for instance, to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136">136</a></span>
emancipate our literature to the same extent
as the literatures of Latin countries move
untrammelled by a hesitancy in the choice of
certain themes. And people at the time, watching
the fate of the prime movers, cried with
a great deal of assurance, ‘That way lies
madness!’</p>

<p>Be this as it may, the men of the nineties
bequeathed a certain subtleness of emotion to
our art that is not without its value. They
took Byron’s satanism and inflamed it with
the lurid light of Baudelaire. <cite>Buveurs de lune</cite>
after the manner of Paul Verlaine, they
evoked something of the ethereal glamour of
moonlight itself. A realist like Crackanthorpe
tried to tread the whole <i xml:lang="it" lang="it">via dolorosa</i>
without faltering by the wayside. Poetry
caught the mood of bizarre crises and Edgar
Wilson wrought a strange delicate world of
visions. In Max Beerbohm irony took on a
weird twinge of grace almost Pierrot-like.
Perhaps, indeed, they all had something of
the Pierrot quality in them. Beardsley himself
was enchanted by that little opera without
words, ‘L’Enfant Prodigue.’ Dowson made a
play about him. <cite>The Happy Hypocrite</cite> might
be a story of the Pierrot himself grown old.</p>

<p>As I have hinted, much of the work conceived<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137">137</a></span>
by these men was doomed to die, as
in the case of every movement. What
then remains, what is their balance to the
good? Who knows? About everything man
has loved and fashioned there abides vestiges
of the interest of humanity. Only some
things are easier to recall than others. They
stand out more, so that one is bound to remark
them. They have, so to speak, a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">cachet</i> of
their own. Among these in this movement
there comes the work of the men I have so
hastily attempted to realise. Each has about
him something of that quality which is indefinable,
but easily recognisable. Each has
his charm for those who care to come with a
loving interest.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
